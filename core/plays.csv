ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew; but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such abundance.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the King's disease.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	A fistula, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I heard not of it before.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive grief the enemy to the living.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	How understand we that?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Save you, fair queen!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	And you, monarch!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	No.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	And no.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Are you meditating on virginity?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Keep him out.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	There is none. Man, setting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	What one, i' faith?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	What's pity?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAGE	Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Under Mars, I.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I especially think, under Mars.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why under Man?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	When he was predominant.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why think you so?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	You go so much backward when you fight.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	That's for advantage.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	So 'tis reported, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Some six months since, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	STEWARD	Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Well, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I do beg your good will in this case.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	In what case?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for they say bames are blessings.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Is this all your worship's reason?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	May the world know them?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer i' th' herd.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th' song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Well, now.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	STEWARD	I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	STEWARD	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	What is your pleasure, madam?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Mine honourable mistress.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	That I am not.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	I say I am your mother.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Nor I your mother?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Good madam, pardon me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Do you love my son?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Your pardon, noble mistress.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Love you my son?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Do not you love him, madam?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Madam, I had.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Wherefore? Tell true.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Dost thou believe't?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Ay, madam, knowingly.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	There's honour in the theft.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Commit it, Count.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	I am your accessary; and so farewell.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Farewell, Captain.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	We shall, noble Captain.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Stay; the King!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	And I will do so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	I'll fee thee to stand up.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	No.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	What her is this?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Nay, come your ways.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	This haste hath wings indeed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	I knew him.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Make thy demand.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	But will you make it even?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Not much commendation to them?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Not much employment for you. You understand me?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	And so 'tis.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	To be relinquish'd of the artists-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Right; so I say.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	That gave him out incurable-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Not to be help'd-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Uncertain life and sure death.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Just; you say well; so would I have said.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	That's it; I would have said the very same.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in respect-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Very hand of heaven.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Ay; so I say.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	In a most weak-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	And debile minister, great power, great transcendence; which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better, whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a coranto.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	'Fore God, I think so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	ALL	We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	And grant it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my life.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	No better, if you please.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FOURTH LORD	Fair one, I think not so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known thee already.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I take her hand.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Your pleasure, sir?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Recantation! My Lord! my master!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Ay; is it not a language I speak?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody succeeding. My master!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age cannot bring thee.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce worth.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee a scruple.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Well, I shall be wiser.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion age will give me leave.                                 Exit
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for you; you have a new mistress.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Who? God?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Ay, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it be conceal'd awhile.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	What's the matter, sweetheart?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	What, what, sweetheart?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know not yet.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very well?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	What two things?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Bless you, my fortunate lady!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why, I say nothing.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title, which is within a very little of nothing.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Away! th'art a knave.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave'; that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	What's his else?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	What more commands he?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	In everything I wait upon his will.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I shall report it so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	You have it from his own deliverance.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	And by other warranted testimony.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Sir!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a very good tailor.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	She is.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Will she away to-night?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	As you'll have her.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's displeasure.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	An idle lord, I swear.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I think so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Why, do you not know him?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Come, come, no more of that.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Pray, sir, your pardon.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Well, what would you say?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	What would you have?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DUKE	Be it his pleasure.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he comes not along with her.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy man.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	By what observance, I pray you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out; and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	What have we here?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	E'en that you have there.                          Exit
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	What is the -matter?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Why should he be kill'd?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Save you, good madam.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Do not say so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Ay, madam.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	And to be a soldier?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Return you thither?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Find you that there?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Ay, madam.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND GENTLEMAN	'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which his heart was not consenting to.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	Parolles, was it not?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Ay, my good lady, he.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	They say the French count has done most honourable service.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	MARIANA	Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as honesty.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	MARIANA	I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Is it yourself?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	If you shall please so, pilgrim.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	You came, I think, from France?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I did so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	His name, I pray you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	What's his name?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Monsieur Parolles.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	MARIANA	The gods forbid else!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Which is the Frenchman?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	I like him well.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Which is he?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Lose our drum! well.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	Marry, hang you!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more in your respect.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	On my life, my lord, a bubble.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your disposition.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	That was not to be blam'd in the command of the service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	It might have been recovered.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	It might, but it is not now.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of our worthiness.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	But you must not now slumber in it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the attempt I vow.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I love not many words.                          Exit
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do, and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	None in the world; but return with an invention, and clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Your brother, he shall go along with me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	But you say she's honest.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Nor would I wish you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	No, sir, I warrant you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	E'en such as you speak to me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	We cannot afford you so.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	'Twould not do.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Hardly serve.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	How deep?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Thirty fathom.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I recover'd it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	A drum now of the enemy's!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	ALL	Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Boskos thromuldo boskos.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	O!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	But wilt thou faithfully?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	If I do not, damn me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND SOLDIER	Captain, I will.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND SOLDIER	So I will, sir.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	They told me that your name was Fontibell.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	No, my good lord, Diana.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	She then was honest.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	So should you be.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	How have I sworn!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Will you not, my lord?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	You have not given him his mother's letter?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd almost into another man.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave of it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves, what things are we!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows himself.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	We will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	I hear there is an overture of peace.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel higher, or return again into France?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his counsel.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal of his act.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	How is this justified?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	The stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Hath the Count all this intelligence?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, to the full arming of the verity.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	They shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th' stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Nothing of me, has 'a?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Bosko chimurcho.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Boblibindo chicurmurco.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	And truly, as I hope to live.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is strong.' What say you to that?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Shall I set down your answer so?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you will.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the chape of his dagger.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Well, that's set down.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	He's very near the truth in this.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Well, that's set down.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are marvellous poor.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	What shall be done to him?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say you to this? What do you know of it?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Do you know this Captain Dumain?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's camp?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	What is his reputation with the Duke?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Marry, we'll search.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I do not know if it be it or no.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Our interpreter does it well.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	Excellently.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	[Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of gold.'
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up again.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all the fry it finds.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Damnable both-sides rogue!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's forehead.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be fain to hang you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die, but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th' stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his honesty?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	I begin to love him for this.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For me, he's more and more a cat.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	What say you to his expertness in war?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity redeems him.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	A pox on him! he's a cat still.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	His qualities being at this poor price, I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Why does he ask him of me?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	What's he?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry, in coming on he has the cramp.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the Florentine?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	I'll whisper with the General, and know his pleasure.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Good morrow, noble Captain.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	God bless you, Captain Parolles.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	SECOND LORD	God save you, noble Captain.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST LORD	Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am for France.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that has a knot on 't yet.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	FIRST SOLDIER	If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak of.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand sallets ere we light on such another herb.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or, rather, the herb of grace.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Your distinction?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	At your service.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	No, no, no.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you are.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Who's that? A Frenchman?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more hotter in France than there.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	What prince is that?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias, the devil.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades' tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily effected.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	COUNTESS	You need but plead your honourable privilege.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of honour; so belike is that.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	But it is your carbonado'd face.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	And you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	I have been sometimes there.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	What's your will?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	The King's not here.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	HELENA	Not here, sir?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	WIDOW	Lord, how we lose our pains!
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	This I'll do for you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by a metaphor.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	CLOWN	Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for other business.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your word.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your hand. How does your drum?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	O my good lord, you were the first that found me.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for you did bring me out.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat. Go to; follow.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	GENTLEMAN	I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	He looks well on 't.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Hers it was not.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I am sure I saw her wear it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	She never saw it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Come hither, Count; do you know these women?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	She's none of mine, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	[To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	What say'st thou to her?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	She hath that ring of yours.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	I have it not.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	What ring was yours, I pray you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	And this was it I gave him, being abed.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Ay, my lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	How, I pray you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	How is that?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	PAROLLES	Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	Ay, my good lord.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Who lent it you?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	It was not lent me neither.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Where did you find it then?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	I found it not.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	I never gave it him.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	LAFEU	This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at pleasure.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	I'll never tell you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Take her away.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	I'll put in bail, my liege.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	I think thee now some common customer.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	DIANA	By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	KING	She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL	BERTRAM	Both, both; o, pardon!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	News, my good lord, from Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Grates me the sum.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	How, my love?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Hear the ambassadors.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DEMETRIUS	Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must charge his horns with garlands!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	Soothsayer!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	Your will?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Good, sir, give me good fortune.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	I make not, but foresee.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Pray, then, foresee me one.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	He means in flesh.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	No, you shall paint when you are old.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Wrinkles forbid!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Hush!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	You shall be more beloving than beloved.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	Nay, hear him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	We'll know all our fortunes.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be- drunk to bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	Your fortunes are alike.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	But how, but how? Give me particulars.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	I have said.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Not in my husband's nose.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Amen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Hush! Here comes Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Not he; the Queen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Saw you my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	No, lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Was he not here?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	No, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Madam?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Against my brother Lucius?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Well, what worst?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	The nature of bad news infects the teller.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Antony, thou wouldst say.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	O, my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST ATTENDANT	The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND ATTENDANT	He stays upon your will.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND MESSENGER	Fulvia thy wife is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Where died she?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	What's your pleasure, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	I must with haste from hence.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	I must be gone.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	She is cunning past man's thought.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Would I had never seen her!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Fulvia?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	And the business you have broach'd here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Where is he?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	I did not see him since.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What should I do I do not?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I am sick and sullen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Now, my dearest queen-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Pray you, stand farther from me.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	The gods best know-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Cleopatra-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Most sweet queen-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	How now, lady!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	You'll heat my blood; no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Now, by my sword-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	I'll leave you, lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Here's more news.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	'Tis pity of him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Charmian!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Madam?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Why, madam?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	You think of him too much.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	O, 'tis treason!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Madam, I trust, not so.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Thou, eunuch Mardian!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MARDIAN	What's your Highness' pleasure?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MARDIAN	Yes, gracious madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Indeed?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What, was he sad or merry?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O that brave Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	The valiant Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Where have you this? 'Tis false.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	From Silvius, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	But small to greater matters must give way.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Not if the small come first.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Welcome to Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Thank you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Sit.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Sit, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	How intend you- practis'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to wars with the women!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Soft, Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	'Tis noble spoken.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Go to, then- your considerate stone!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Give me leave, Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Speak, Agrippa.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Will Caesar speak?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Happily, amen!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Where lies he?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	About the Mount Misenum.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	What is his strength by land?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	Welcome from Egypt, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable friend, Agrippa!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Good Enobarbus!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there. Is this true?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for her.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	O, rare for Antony!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Rare Egyptian!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	Now Antony must leave her utterly.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	Good night, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	If you can- your reason.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOOTHSAYER	I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue; but yet hie you to Egypt again.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Speak this no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	BOTH	Sir, good success!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Let it alone! Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MARDIAN	As well as I can, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Madam, madam-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	First, madam, he is well.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Good madam, hear me.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Will't please you hear me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Madam, he's well.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Well said.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	And friends with Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Th'art an honest man.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Make thee a fortune from me.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	But yet, madam-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	For what good turn?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	For the best turn i' th' bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I am pale, Charmian.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Madam, he's married to Octavia.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Good madam, patience.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	He's married, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.    [Draws a knife]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	He is afear'd to come.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	I have done my duty.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	He's married, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Should I lie, madam?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	I crave your Highness' pardon.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	He is married?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Good your Highness, patience.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	In praising Antony I have disprais'd Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Many times, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Take your time.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	There's the point.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	That's our offer.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Well met here.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	That's the next to do.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	That will I, Pompey.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	You have heard much.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	I have fair meanings, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	And fair words to them.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	No more of that! He did so.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	What, I pray you?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	I know thee now. How far'st thou, soldier?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Show's the way, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Come.               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have made this treaty.- You and I have known, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	At sea, I think.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	We have, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	You have done well by water.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	And you by land.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	I Will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Nor what I have done by water.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	And you by land.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	No slander: they steal hearts.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	We came hither to fight with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	If he do, sure he cannot weep't back again.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Y'have said, sir. We look'd not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Caesar' sister is call'd Octavia.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Pray ye, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	'Tis true.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Who would not have his wife so?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	I shall take it, sir. We have us'd our throats in Egypt.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SERVANT	Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them down.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SERVANT	Lepidus is high-colour'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SERVANT	They have made him drink alms-drink.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SERVANT	As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out 'No more!'; reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th' drink.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SERVANT	But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SERVANT	Why, this it is to have a name in great men's fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partizan I could not heave.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Y'have strange serpents there.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Ay, Lepidus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	They are so.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Sit- and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Not till you have slept. I fear me you'll be in till then.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things. Without contradiction I have heard that.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear; what is't?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth; it is just so high as it is, and moves with it own organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	What colour is it of?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Of it own colour too.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	LEPIDUS	'Tis a strange serpent.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Will this description satisfy him?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS] I think th'art mad. [Rises and walks aside] The matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	What say'st thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	How should that be?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Hast thou drunk well?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Show me which way.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	This health to Lepidus!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Here's to thee, Menas!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Enobarbus, welcome!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Fill till the cup be hid.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Why?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Drink thou; increase the reels.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MENAS	Come.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Be a child o' th' time.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	Let's ha't, good soldier.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	POMPEY	I'll try you on the shore.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Hoo! says 'a. There's my cap.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SILIUS	Where is he now?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	What, are the brothers parted?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	'Tis a noble Lepidus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar'- go no further.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Both he loves.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	No further, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	I have said.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	My noble brother!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	Sir, look well to my husband's house; and-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	What, Octavia?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	I'll tell you in your ear.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	[Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Adieu; be happy!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Farewell, farewell!                   [Kisses OCTAVIA]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Where is the fellow?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALEXAS	Half afeard to come.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Most gracious Majesty!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Didst thou behold Octavia?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Ay, dread Queen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Where?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Is she as tall as me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	She is not, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu'd or low?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Madam, I heard her speak: she is low-voic'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	That's not so good. He cannot like her long.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Like her? O Isis! 'tis impossible.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Is this certain?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Or I have no observance.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Excellent.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Guess at her years, I prithee.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Widow? Charmian, hark!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	And I do think she's thirty.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Bear'st thou her face in mind? Is't long or round?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	Round even to faultiness.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	A proper man.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Nothing, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	How now, friend Eros!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	There's strange news come, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	What, man?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	This is old. What is the success?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Our great navy's rigg'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	This in the public eye?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Who does he accuse?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Sir, this should be answer'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MAECENAS	He'll never yield to that.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	That ever I should call thee cast-away!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	Do not say so, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	My lord, in Athens.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Welcome, lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	OCTAVIA	Is it so, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	But why, why,
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Well, is it, is it?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What is't you say?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	By sea! What else?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CANIDIUS	Why will my lord do so?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	For that he dares us to't.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	By sea, by sea.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	I'll fight at sea.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOLDIER	By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CANIDIUS	Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOLDIER	They say one Taurus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MESSENGER	The Emperor calls Canidius.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Taurus!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	TAURUS	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	What's thy passion?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	How appears the fight?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CANIDIUS	Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Fly? Not we!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Nay, gentle madam, to him! Comfort him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Do, most dear Queen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Do? Why, what else?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Let me sit down. O Juno!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	No, no, no, no, no.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	See you here, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	O, fie, fie, fie!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Madam!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Madam, O good Empress!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Sir, sir!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Ah, stand by!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	The Queen, my lord, the Queen!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Sir, the Queen.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	O, my pardon!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Pardon, pardon!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Approach, and speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Be't so. Declare thine office.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EUPHRONIUS	Fortune pursue thee!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THYREUS	Caesar, I go.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What shall we do, Enobarbus?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	Think, and die.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Is Antony or we in fault for this?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Is that his answer?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EUPHRONIUS	Ay, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EUPHRONIUS	He says so.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	That head, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SERVANT	A messenger from Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Caesar's will?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THYREUS	Hear it apart.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	None but friends: say boldly.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THYREUS	So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Go on. Right royal!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	O!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What's your name?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THYREUS	My name is Thyreus.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	[Aside] You will be whipt.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THYMUS	Mark Antony-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Good my lord-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	O, is't come to this?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Wherefore is this?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SERVANT	Soundly, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SERVANT	He did ask favour.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Have you done yet?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I must stay his time.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Not know me yet?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Cold-hearted toward me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	That's my brave lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	We will yet do well.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Call all his noble captains to my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	He will not fight with me, Domitius?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	No.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Why should he not?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	[Aside to ENOBARBUS] What means this?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SERVANT	The gods forbid!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SOLDIER	Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SOLDIER	Nothing. What news?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SOLDIER	Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SOLDIER	Soldiers, have careful watch.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SOLDIER	Peace, what noise?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THIRD SOLDIER	List, list!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SOLDIER	Hark!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THIRD SOLDIER	Music i' th' air.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FOURTH SOLDIER	Under the earth.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THIRD SOLDIER	It signs well, does it not?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FOURTH SOLDIER	No.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND SOLDIER	How now, masters!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST SOLDIER	Ay; is't not strange?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THIRD SOLDIER	Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Eros! mine armour, Eros!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Sleep a little.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Sooth, la, I'll help. Thus it must be.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Briefly, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Is not this buckled well?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAPTAIN	The morn is fair. Good morrow, General.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Good morrow, General.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Please you retire to your chamber?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOLDIER	The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Who's gone this morning?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	What say'st thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Is he gone?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SOLDIER	Most certain.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	AGRIPPA	Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	I give it you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Thou bleed'st apace.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	They do retire.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ENOBARBUS	O, bear me witness, night-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND WATCH	What man is this?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST WATCH	Stand close and list him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CENTURION	Enobarbus?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST WATCH	Let's speak to him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND WATCH	Let's do so. But he sleeps.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST WATCH	Go we to him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND WATCH	Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST WATCH	Hear you, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SCARUS	For both, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Ay, noble lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Ay, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	It does, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Dead then?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	MARDIAN	Dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	What would my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	I would not see't.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	O, sir, pardon me!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	My sword is drawn.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	'Tis said, man; and farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EROS	Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Now, Eros.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	What's the noise?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND GUARD	The star is fall'n.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	And time is at his period.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Alas, and woe!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	Not I.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND GUARD	Nor I.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	THIRD GUARD	Nor any one.                         Exeunt guard
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DIOMEDES	Where's Antony?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DERCETAS	There, Diomed, there.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	When did she send thee?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DIOMEDES	Now, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Where is she?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Most heavy day!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	O Charmian, I will never go from hence!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Be comforted, dear madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ANTONY	O, quick, or I am gone.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	A heavy sight!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	They do not go together.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O, quietness, lady!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	She's dead too, our sovereign.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Lady!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Madam!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O madam, madam, madam!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Royal Egypt, Empress!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Peace, peace, Iras!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	What is't thou say'st?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DERCETAS	I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	EGYPTIAN	So the gods preserve thee!                      Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	PROCULEIUS	Caesar, I shall.                              Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	ALL	Dolabella!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What's thy name?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	PROCULEIUS	My name is Proculeius.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	Royal Queen!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O Cleopatra! thou art taken, Queen!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Quick, quick, good hands.        [Drawing a dagger]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	PROCULEIUS	O, temperance, lady!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	I cannot tell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Assuredly you know me.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	I understand not, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	If it might please ye-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Most sovereign creature-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Cleopatra-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Gentle madam, no.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Nay, pray you, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Though he be honourable-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Which is the Queen of Egypt?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	It is the Emperor, madam.        [CLEOPATPA kneels]
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SELEUCUS	Here, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	What have I kept back?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SELEUCUS	Enough to purchase what you have made known.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Good Queen, let us entreat you.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Forbear, Seleucus.                       Exit SELEUCUS
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	My master and my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Where's the Queen?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Behold, sir.                                    Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Dolabella!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	The gods forbid!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	IRAS	O the good gods!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Nay, that's certain.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	GUARDSMAN	This is the man.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	Truly, I have him. But I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Remember'st thou any that have died on't?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty; how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm's an odd worm.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Get thee hence; farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Ay, ay; farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Will it eat me?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLOWN	You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in every ten that they make the devils mar five.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CLEOPATRA	Well, get thee gone; farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O Eastern star!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	O, break! O, break!
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	Where's the Queen?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CHARMIAN	Speak softly, wake her not.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	Caesar hath sent-
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguil'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND GUARD	There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	FIRST GUARD	What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	How goes it here?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	SECOND GUARD	All dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	DOLABELLA	Who was last with them?
THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	CAESAR	Poison'd then.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.                                           [ADAM retires]
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Know you where you are, sir?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ADAM	[Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's remembrance, be at accord.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Let me go, I say.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DENNIS	Calls your worship?
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
AS YOU LIKE IT	DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new court?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke; and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished with her father?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Where will the old Duke live?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd as mine is to thee.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Were you made the messenger?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath, fool?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decrees.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank-
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Alas!
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Or I, I promise thee.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	And mine to eke out hers.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Your heart's desires be with you!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CHARLES	No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me before; but come your ways.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.                                          [They wrestle]
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O excellent young man!
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	No more, no more.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Will you go, coz?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	But is all this for your father?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of briers is this working-day world!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Hem them away.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the Duke.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	With his eyes full of anger.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Me, uncle?
AS YOU LIKE IT	FREDERICK	Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I have more cause.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	That he hath not.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Why, whither shall we go?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Who's there?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Why, what's the matter?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ADAM	No matter whither, so you come not here.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel, and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat; therefore, courage, good Aliena.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you have no money in your purse.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Who calls?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Else are they very wretched.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing. Will you sing?
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	And I'll sing it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AMIENS	What's that 'ducdame'?
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FIRST LORD	He saves my labour by his own approach.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	What, for a counter, would I do but good?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I almost die for food, and let me have it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	No, truly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damn'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Nay, I hope.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you know, are greasy.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance; come.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are perfum'd with civet.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right butter-women's rank to market.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Out, fool!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have patience, good people.'
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with him, sirrah.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hang'd and carved upon these trees?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Is it a man?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I prithee, who?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Nay, but who is it?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Is it possible?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Nay, he hath but a little beard.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels and your heart both in an instant.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Orlando?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Orlando.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropp'd acorn.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth such fruit.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Give me audience, good madam.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Proceed.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out of tune.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Rosalind is your love's name?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Yes, just.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I do not like her name.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	What stature is she of?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear, forester?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Very well; what would you?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I pray you, what is't o'clock?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in the forest.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as proper?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles withal.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Where dwell you, pretty youth?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	There were none principal; they were all like one another as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I prithee recount some of them.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your remedy.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	What were his marks?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I would not be cured, youth.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	With all my heart, good youth.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatch'd house!
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest; now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	[Aside] A material fool!
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in this place of the forest, and to couple us.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Well, the gods give us joy!
AS YOU LIKE IT	MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man.
AS YOU LIKE IT	MARTEXT	Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	[Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Will you be married, motley?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Never talk to me; I will weep.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Do you think so?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Not true in love?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke, your father.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Well, and what of him?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	I would have you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Phebe, with all my heart.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's, which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to travel for it too.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll warrant him heart-whole.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be woo'd of a snail.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Of a snail!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	What's that?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	What, of my suit?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of her.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Then, in mine own person, I die.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, I will grant it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Then love me, Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, and twenty such.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	What sayest thou?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Are you not good?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I hope so.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Pray thee, marry us.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I cannot say the words.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I will.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, but when?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have possess'd her.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	For ever and a day.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit, whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be with thee again.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?
AS YOU LIKE IT	LORD	Sir, it was I.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
AS YOU LIKE IT	LORD	Yes, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Call you this railing?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Alas, poor shepherd!
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I am. What must we understand by this?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	I pray you, tell it.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Are you his brother?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Was't you he rescu'd?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	But for the bloody napkin?
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CELIA	There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Look, he recovers.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I would I were at home.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Counterfeit, I assure you.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman's saying.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Good ev'n, Audrey.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	God ye good ev'n, William.
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	And good ev'n to you, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Five and twenty, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	A ripe age. Is thy name William?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	William, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I thank God.
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Faith, sir, so so.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	I do, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	No, sir.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
AS YOU LIKE IT	WILLIAM	Which he, sir?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
AS YOU LIKE IT	AUDREY	Do, good William.
AS YOU LIKE IT	CORIN	Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	God save you, brother.
AS YOU LIKE IT	OLIVER	And you, fair sister.                             Exit
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	It is my arm.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he show'd me your handkercher?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	I'll not fail, if I live.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	Nor I.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we be married.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FIRST PAGE	Well met, honest gentleman.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
AS YOU LIKE IT	SECOND PAGE	We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FIRST PAGE	Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
AS YOU LIKE IT	FIRST PAGE	YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our time.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	And you say you will have her when I bring her?
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	That will I, should I die the hour after.
AS YOU LIKE IT	PHEBE	So is the bargain.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ROSALIND	You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
AS YOU LIKE IT	SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are call'd fools.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all!
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	And how was that ta'en up?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
AS YOU LIKE IT	TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords and parted.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
AS YOU LIKE IT	ORLANDO	If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
AS YOU LIKE IT	JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.
AS YOU LIKE IT	DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Speak, speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Resolv'd, resolv'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	We know't, we know't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. Is't a verdict?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	No more talking on't; let it be done. Away, away!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	One word, good citizens.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Against him first; he's a very dog to the commonalty.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Consider you what services he has done for his country?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Very well, and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proud.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Nay, but speak not maliciously.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	I say unto you, what he hath done famously he did it to that end; though soft-conscienc'd men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	What he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.  [Shouts within]  What shouts are these? The other side o' th' city is risen. Why stay we prating here? To th' Capitol!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Come, come.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always lov'd the people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	He's one honest enough; would all the rest were so!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Our business is not unknown to th' Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	We cannot, sir; we are undone already.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er car'd for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses cramm'd with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there's all the love they bear us.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Well, I'll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But, an't please you, deliver.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Well, what then?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Y'are long about it.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Ay, sir; well, well.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	It was an answer. How apply you this?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	I the great toe? Why the great toe?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	We have ever your good word.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	What is granted them?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	This is strange.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	Where's Caius Marcius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	Here. What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	You have fought together?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	It is your former promise.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	O, true bred!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Noble Marcius!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	He has no equal.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	When we were chosen tribunes for the people-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Nay, but his taunts!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Being mov'd, he will not spare to gird the gods.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Bemock the modest moon.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	The gods assist you!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	And keep your honours safe!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	Farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SENATOR	Farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied, and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way; when, for a day of kings' entreaties, a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honour would become such a person- that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th' wall, if renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where he was to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return'd his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	GENTLEWOMAN	Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	My ladies both, good day to you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Sweet madam!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	I am glad to see your ladyship.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	One on's father's moods.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	A crack, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	Not out of doors!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	She shall, she shall.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Why, I pray you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	O, good madam, there can be none yet.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Indeed, madam?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o' door and go along with us.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not. I wish you much mirth.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	Yonder comes news; a wager- they have met.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	My horse to yours- no.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	'Tis done.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	Agreed.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	Say, has our general met the enemy?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	So, the good horse is mine.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	I'll buy him of you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	How far off lie these armies?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	Within this mile and half.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	O, they are at it!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	Fool-hardiness; not I.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SOLDIER	Not I.                    [MARCIUS is shut in]
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	See, they have shut him in.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	What is become of Marcius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Slain, sir, doubtless.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	Look, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST ROMAN	This will I carry to Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND ROMAN	And I this.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	Above an hour, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	Come I too late?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MARCIUS	Come I too late?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	But how prevail'd you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LIEUTENANT	Fear not our care, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	I shall, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Take't- 'tis yours; what is't?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	Marcius, his name?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	The town is ta'en.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	He's the devil.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SOLDIER	Will not you go?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Good or bad?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Marcius.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Pray you, who does the wolf love?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	The lamb.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	He's a bear indeed, that lives fike a lamb. You two are old men; tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Well, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	He's poor in no one fault, but stor'd with all.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Especially in pride.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	And topping all others in boasting.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censured here in the city- I mean of us o' th' right-hand file? Do you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Why, how are we censur'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Well, well, sir, well.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	We do it not alone, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I know you can do very little alone; for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single: your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride. O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	What then, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates-alias fools- as any in Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs; you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a fosset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch'd with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for the love of Juno, let's go.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Ha! Marcius coming home?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA	Nay, 'tis true.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Look, here's a letter from him; the state hath another, his wife another; and I think there's one at home for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I will make my very house reel to-night. A letter for me?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years' health; in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	O, no, no, no.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings a victory in his pocket? The wounds become him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	On's brows, Menenius, he comes the third time home with the oaken garland.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that; an he had stay'd by him, I would not have been so fidius'd for all the chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them. Is the Senate possess'd of this?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes: the Senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war; he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VALERIA	In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	The gods grant them true!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	True! pow, waw.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	One i' th' neck and two i' th' thigh- there's nine that I know.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	He had before this last expedition twenty-five wounds upon him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Look, sir, your mother!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Now the gods crown thee!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	And live you yet?  [To VALERIA]  O my sweet lady, pardon.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Ever right.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Menenius ever, ever.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	HERALD	Give way there, and go on.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	In that there's comfort.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	'Tis right.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	'Tis most like he will.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST OFFICER	Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for consulships?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST OFFICER	That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST OFFICER	If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to flatter them for their love.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND OFFICER	He hath deserved worthily of his country; and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all, into their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard it.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Pray now, sit down.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Worthy man!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Mark you that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	You see how he intends to use the people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	We may, sir, if we will.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	We have been call'd so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely colour'd; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o' th' compass.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's will- 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty 'twould sure southward.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Why that way?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	YOU are never without your tricks; you may, you may.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	Content, content.                         Exeunt citizens
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Mine own desert.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	Your own desert?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Ay, not mine own desire.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	How, not your own desire?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	No, sir, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	YOU MUST think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Well then, I pray, your price o' th' consulship?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	The price is to ask it kindly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Kindly, sir, I pray let me ha't. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private. Your good voice, sir; what say you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	But this is something odd.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FOURTH CITIZEN	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Your enigma?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FOURTH CITIZEN	You have been a scourge to her enemies; you have been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	You should account me the more virtuous, that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account gentle; and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you I may be consul.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIFTH CITIZEN	We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FOURTH CITIZEN	You have received many wounds for your country.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no farther.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SIXTH CITIZEN	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SEVENTH CITIZEN	Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Is this done?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Where? At the Senate House?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	There, Coriolanus.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	May I change these garments?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	You may, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I'll keep you company. Will you along?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	We stay here for the people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	How now, my masters! Have you chose this man?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	He has our voices, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	No, 'tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Why, so he did, I am sure.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL	No, no; no man saw 'em.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Tullus Aufidius, then, had made new head?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Saw you Aufidius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Spoke he of me?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	He did, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	How? What?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	At Antium lives he?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LARTIUS	At Antium.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Pass no further.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Ha! What is that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	It will be dangerous to go on- no further.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	What makes this change?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	The matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Cominius, no.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Have I had children's voices?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	The people are incens'd against him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Be calm, be calm.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Why, this was known before.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Not to them all.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Have you inform'd them sithence?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	How? I inform them!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	You are like to do such business.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Let's be calm.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Not now, not now.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	Not in this heat, sir, now.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Well, no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	No more words, we beseech you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	What, what? his choler?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	'Twas from the canon.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Well, on to th' market-place.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Well, well, no more of that.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Come, enough.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Enough, with over measure.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Has said enough.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Manifest treason!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	This a consul? No.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Hence, old goat!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PATRICIANS	We'll surety him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Ag'd sir, hands off.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	On both sides more respect.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Here's he that would take from you all your power.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PATRICIANS	Peace, peace, peace; stay, hold, peace!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Hear me, people; peace!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	Let's hear our tribune. Peace! Speak, speak, speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	What is the city but the people?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	You so remain.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	And so are like to do.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	This deserves death.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	AEdiles, seize him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	Yield, Marcius, yield.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILES	Peace, peace!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Lay hands upon him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SENATOR	Get you gone.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Shall it be put to that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Come, sir, along with us.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PATRICIANS	This man has marr'd his fortune.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PATRICIANS	I would they were a-bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	You worthy Tribunes-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	He shall, sure on't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Sir, sir-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Peace!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Consul! What consul?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	The consul Coriolanus.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	He consul!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	No, no, no, no, no.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	He's a disease that must be cut away.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	This is clean kam.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	If it were so-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Go not home.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST PATRICIAN	You do the nobler.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Let go.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Let them hang.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	What must I do?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Return to th' tribunes.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Well, what then, what then?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Tush, tush!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	A good demand.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Why force you this?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Only fair speech.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Come, come, we'll prompt you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Do your will.                                   Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	He's coming.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	How accompanied?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	I have; 'tis ready.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Have you corrected them by tribes?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	I have.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	I shall inform them.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	Very well.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Well, here he comes.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Calmly, I do beseech you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SENATOR	Amen, amen!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Draw near, ye people.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AEDILE	List to your tribunes. Audience! peace, I say!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	First, hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Well, say. Peace, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	I am content.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Well, well! No more.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Answer to us.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Say then; 'tis true, I ought so.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	How- traitor?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Nay, temperately! Your promise.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Mark you this, people?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	What do you prate of service?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	I talk of that that know it.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	You!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Is this the promise that you made your mother?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Know, I pray you-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Hear me, my masters and my common friends-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	He's sentenc'd; no more hearing.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	We know your drift. Speak what?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	It shall be so, it shall be so.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	Our enemy is banish'd, he is gone! Hoo-oo!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	O heavens! O heavens!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Nay, I prithee, woman-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	O the gods!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Let's not meet her.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Why?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	They say she's mad.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	They have ta'en note of us; keep on your way.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Peace, peace, be not so loud.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Are you mankind?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	O blessed heavens!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	What then?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Come, come, peace.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	I would he had.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Pray, let's go.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	Well, well, we'll leave you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	I know you well, sir, and you know me; your name, I think, is Adrian.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	Nicanor? No!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	The same, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	YOU had more beard when I last saw you, but your favour is well appear'd by your tongue. What's the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state, to find you out there. You have well saved me a day's journey.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	There hath been in Rome strange insurrections: the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	Hath been! Is it ended, then? Our state thinks not so; they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	Coriolanus banish'd!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	Banish'd, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is when she's fall'n out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request of his country.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you; you have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	I shall between this and supper tell you most strange things from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	A most royal one: the centurions and their charges, distinctly billeted, already in th' entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ROMAN	I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLSCE	You take my part from me, sir. I have the most cause to be glad of yours.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CITIZEN	And you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Which is his house, beseech you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CITIZEN	This here before you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his head that he gives entrance to such companions? Pray get you out.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Away!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Away? Get you away.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Now th' art troublesome.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	What fellow's this?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	A strange one as ever I look'd on. I cannot get him out o' th' house. Prithee call my master to him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you avoid the house.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Let me but stand- I will not hurt your hearth.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	What are you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	A gentleman.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	A marv'llous poor one.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	True, so I am.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other station; here's no place for you. Pray you avoid. Come.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	What, you will not? Prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	And I shall.                              Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	Where dwell'st thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Under the canopy.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	Under the canopy?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	Where's that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	I' th' city of kites and crows.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	No, I serve not thy master.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	How, sir! Do you meddle with my master?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	Where is this fellow?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Here, sir; I'd have beaten him like a dog, but for disturbing the lords within.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	What is thy name?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	I know thee not. Thy name?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	You bless me, gods!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Here's a strange alteration!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	What an arm he has! He turn'd me about with his finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him; he had, sir, a kind of face, methought- I cannot tell how to term it.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	He had so, looking as it were- Would I were hang'd, but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	So did I, I'll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i' th' world.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	I think he is; but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Who, my master?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Nay, it's no matter for that.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Worth six on him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the greater soldier.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that; for the defence of a town our general is excellent.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	O slaves, I can tell you news- news, you rascals!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH	What, what, what? Let's partake.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH	Wherefore? wherefore?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Why do you say 'thwack our general'?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	I do not say 'thwack our general,' but he was always good enough for him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	Come, we are fellows and friends. He was ever too hard for him, I have heard him say so himself.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth on't; before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a carbonado.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	An he had been cannibally given, he might have broil'd and eaten him too.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	But more of thy news!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	Do't! He will do't; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not- look you, sir- show themselves, as we term it, his friends, whilst he's in directitude.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Directitude? What's that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel an with him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	But when goes this forward?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD SERVANT	To-morrow, to-day, presently. You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon; 'tis as it were parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND SERVANT	'Tis so; and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST SERVANT	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	We stood to't in good time. Is this Menenius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Hail to you both!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Where is he, hear you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CITIZENS	The gods preserve you both!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	God-den, our neighbours.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	God-den to you all, god-den to you an.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Live and thrive!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CITIZENS	Now the gods keep you!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Farewell, farewell.             Exeunt citizens
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I think not so.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Come, what talk you of Marcius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	What more fearful?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	This is most likely!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	The very trick on 't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	O, you have made good work!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	What news? what news?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	What's the news? What's the news?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	But is this true, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BOTH TRIBUNES	Say not we brought it.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	PLEBEIANS	Faith, we hear fearful news.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND CITIZEN	And so did I.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	THIRD CITIZEN	And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did, we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our will.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	Y'are goodly things, you voices!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CITIZEN	The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. I ever said we were i' th' wrong when we banish'd him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	BRUTUS	I do not like this news.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Nor I.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	Do they still fly to th' Roman?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LIEUTENANT	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	He would not seem to know me.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Do you hear?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	No; I'll not meddle.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Pray you go to him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	What should I do?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	COMINIUS	He'll never hear him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Not?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	Stay. Whence are you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND WATCH	Stand, and go back.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	From whence?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	From Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND WATCH	Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore go back.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Has he din'd, canst thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after dinner.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	You are a Roman, are you?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I am as thy general is.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, when you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them, and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv'd; therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemn'd; our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	Come, my captain knows you not.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I mean thy general.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	My general cares not for you. Back, I say; go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood. Back- that's the utmost of your having. Back.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Away!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	How! away!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND WATCH	'Tis a spell, you see, of much power! You know the way home again.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND WATCH	What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST WATCH	A noble fellow, I warrant him.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VIRGILIA	My lord and husband!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	VOLUMNIA	Your knee, sirrah.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	That's my brave boy.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	I was mov'd withal.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	See you yond coign o' th' Capitol, yond cornerstone?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Why, what of that?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger, there is some hope the ladies of Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. But I say there is no hope in't; our throats are sentenc'd, and stay upon execution.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown from man to dragon; he has wings, he's more than a creeping thing.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	He lov'd his mother dearly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	So did he me; and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes; when he walks, he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading. He is able to pierce a corslet with his eye, talks like a knell, and his hum is a battery. He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander. What he bids be done is finish'd with his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity, and a heaven to throne in.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	Yes- mercy, if you report him truly.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MENENIUS	I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him. There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that shall our poor city find. And all this is 'long of you.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	The gods be good unto us!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	What's the news?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SICINIUS	They are near the city?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	MESSENGER	Almost at point to enter.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST CONSPIRATOR	How is it with our general?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LORDS	You are most welcome home.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LORDS	We have.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Traitor! How now?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	Ay, traitor, Marcius.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Marcius!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	Name not the god, thou boy of tears-
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CORIOLANUS	Ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	-no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST LORD	Peace, both, and hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	CONSPIRATORS	Let him die for't.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	ALL THE PEOPLE	Tear him to pieces. Do it presently. He kill'd my son. My daughter. He kill'd my cousin Marcus. He kill'd my father.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	Insolent villain!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	LORDS	Hold, hold, hold, hold!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	AUFIDIUS	My noble masters, hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	FIRST LORD	O Tullus!
THE TRAGEDY OF CORIOLANUS	SECOND LORD	Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	But what's the matter?
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	None but the King?
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	And why so?
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	You speak him far.
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	What's his name and birth?
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	How long is this ago?
CYMBELINE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Some twenty years.
CYMBELINE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	I do well believe you.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Alack, the King!
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Past grace? obedience?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Past hope, and in despair; that way past grace.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	O thou vile one!
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	What, art thou mad?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	My lord your son drew on my master.
CYMBELINE	QUEEN	I am very glad on't.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	I humbly thank your Highness.
CYMBELINE	QUEEN	Pray walk awhile.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] No, faith; not so much as his patience.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' th' back side the town.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	The villain would not stand me.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Stand you? You have land enough of your own; but he added to your having, gave you some ground.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	I would they had not come between us.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] So would I, till you had measur'd how long a fool you were upon the ground.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn'd.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together; she's a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	You'll go with us?
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	I'll attend your lordship.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Nay, come, let's go together.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	It was: his queen, his queen!
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Then wav'd his handkerchief?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	And kiss'd it, madam.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Madam, so I did.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of. But I could then have look'd on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	I have seen him in France; we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	And then his banishment.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar, without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	Sir, you o'errate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences; but upon my mended judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not altogether slight.
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall'n both.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	Safely, I think. 'Twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable, than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion, by this, worn out.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	I prais'd her as I rated her. So do I my stone.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	What do you esteem it at?
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	More than the world enjoys.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's outpriz'd by a trifle.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Which the gods have given you?
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Which by their graces I will keep.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stol'n too. So your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual; a cunning thief, or a that-way-accomplish'd courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	Let us leave here, gentlemen.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	No, no.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring, which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and, to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	What's that?
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more- a punishment too.
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly; let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th' approbation of what I have spoke!
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	What lady would you choose to assail?
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's spoken, I swear.
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	I will have it no lay.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours- provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her, and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate; if she remain unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Your hand- a covenant! We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Agreed.                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
CYMBELINE	FRENCHMAN	Will this hold, think you?
CYMBELINE	LADY	I, madam.
CYMBELINE	QUEEN	[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.
CYMBELINE	CORNELIUS	I humbly take my leave.                        Exit
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	What makes your admiration?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	What is the matter, trow?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Continues well my lord? His health beseech you?
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Well, madam.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Will my lord say so?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Not he, I hope.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	What do you pity, sir?
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Two creatures heartily.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Let me hear no more.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	What ho, Pisanio!
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Let me my service tender on your lips.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	You make amends.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	All's well, sir; take my pow'r i' th' court for yours.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Pray what is't?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	O, no, no.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of him, and might not spend them at my pleasure.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all out.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths. Ha?
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	No, my lord; [Aside] nor crop the ears of them.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been one of my rank!
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] To have smell'd like a fool.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	I am not vex'd more at anything in th' earth. A pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am; they dare not fight with me, because of the Queen my mother. Every jackslave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your comb on.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Sayest thou?
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offence to.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to my inferiors.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Why, so I say.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	A stranger, and I not known on't?
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Leonatus? A banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	One of your lordship's pages.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in't?
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	You cannot derogate, my lord.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Not easily, I think.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Who's there? My woman? Helen?
CYMBELINE	LADY	Please you, madam.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	What hour is it?
CYMBELINE	LADY	Almost midnight, madam.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turn'd up ace.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	It would make any man cold to lose.
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning, is't not?
CYMBELINE	FIRST LORD	Day, my lord.
CYMBELINE	SECOND LORD	Here comes the King.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.- Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.
CYMBELINE	LADY	Who's there that knocks?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	A gentleman.
CYMBELINE	LADY	No more?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Your lady's person; is she ready?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	There is gold for you; sell me your good report.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Still I swear I love you.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	This is no answer.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Fools are not mad folks.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Do you call me fool?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	The south fog rot him!
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	'His garments'! Now the devil-
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	'His garment'!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	'Twill not be lost.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	I hope so. Go and search.                 Exit PISANIO
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	I will inform your father.
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	What means do you make to him?
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	See! Iachimo!
CYMBELINE	PHILARIO	Welcome, sir.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Here are letters for you.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Their tenour good, I trust.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	'Tis very like.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	The stone's too hard to come by.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Proceed.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	She writes so to you, doth she?
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	By Jupiter, I had it from her arm!
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	Will you hear more?
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	I'll be sworn-
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	I'll deny nothing.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Come, there's no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, as I said, there is no moe such Caesars. Other of them may have crook'd noses; but to owe such straight arms, none.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Son, let your mother end.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	We do.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Let proof speak.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	His majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there's an end.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	So, sir.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	How now, Pisanio!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Madam, you're best consider.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Hail, heaven!
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Hail, heaven!
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Uncertain favour!
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life; I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike, and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.'
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Alas, good lady!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Good madam, hear me.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Do't, and to bed then.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	I'll wake mine eyeballs first.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Some Roman courtezan!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	If you'll back to th' court-
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Thus far; and so farewell.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Your hand, my lord.
CYMBELINE	QUEEN	Son, I say, follow the King.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	O good my lord!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	O my all-worthy lord!
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Humh!
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Sirrah, is this letter true?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Sir, as I think.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry- that is, what villainy soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it directly and truly- I would think thee an honest man; thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Well, my good lord.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Sir, I will.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy first service; go.
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	I shall, my lord.                                Exit
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Ay, my noble lord.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	How long is't since she went to Milford Haven?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	She can scarce be there yet.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	I am thoroughly weary.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	What's the matter, sir?
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Money, youth?
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	Whither bound?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	To Milford Haven.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	What's your name?
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	He wrings at some distress.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Would I could free't!
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	[Whispering] Hark, boys.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Pray draw near.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Thanks, sir.
CYMBELINE	TRIBUNE	Is Lucius general of the forces?
CYMBELINE	SECOND SENATOR	Ay.
CYMBELINE	TRIBUNE	Remaining now in Gallia?
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	What? how? how?
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Brother, farewell.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	I wish ye sport.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Your health. [To BELARIUS] So please you, sir.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	We'll not be long away.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	How angel-like he sings!
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	What's thy name?
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Cloten, thou villain.
CYMBELINE	CLOTEN	Art not afeard?
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	No company's abroad.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	None in the world; you did mistake him, sure.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	What hast thou done?
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	We are all undone.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Is he at home?
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	He went hence even now.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Where?
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Say, where shall's lay him?
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	By good Euriphile, our mother.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	We'll speak it, then.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	'Tis true.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Come on, then, and remove him.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Fear no more the lightning flash,
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Nor th' all-dreaded thunder-stone;
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Fear not slander, censure rash;
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Thou hast finish'd joy and moan.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	No exorciser harm thee!
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Nothing ill come near thee!
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	But what from Rome?
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	When expect you them?
CYMBELINE	CAPTAIN	With the next benefit o' th' wind.
CYMBELINE	CAPTAIN	He's alive, my lord.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Thy name?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	The noise is round about us.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	Let us from it.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	So say I. Amen.
CYMBELINE	IACHIMO	'Tis their fresh supplies.
CYMBELINE	LORD	Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?
CYMBELINE	LORD	I did.
CYMBELINE	LORD	Where was this lane?
CYMBELINE	LORD	Nay, be not angry, sir.
CYMBELINE	LORD	Farewell; you're angry.                             Exit
CYMBELINE	SECOND GAOLER	Ay, or a stomach.                Exeunt GAOLERS
CYMBELINE	ALL	Thanks, Jupiter!
CYMBELINE	GAOLER	Come, sir, are you ready for death?
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
CYMBELINE	GAOLER	Hanging is the word, sir; if you be ready for that, you are well cook'd.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
CYMBELINE	GAOLER	Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache. But a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Yes indeed do I, fellow.
CYMBELINE	GAOLER	Your death has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so pictur'd. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril. And how you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to tell one.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.
CYMBELINE	MESSENGER	Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Thou bring'st good news: I am call'd to be made free.
CYMBELINE	GAOLER	I'll be hang'd then.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.                         Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	No tidings of him?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Prithee say.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Heard you all this, her women?
CYMBELINE	LADY	We did, so please your Highness.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	I humbly thank your Highness.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Wherefore ey'st him so?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	Is not this boy reviv'd from death?
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	The same dead thing alive.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	But we saw him dead.
CYMBELINE	BELARIUS	Be silent; let's see further.
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	[Aside] What's that to him?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	How? me?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	All that belongs to this.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Nay, nay, to th' purpose.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Peace, my lord. Hear, hear!
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Does the world go round?
CYMBELINE	POSTHUMUS	How comes these staggers on me?
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	Wake, my mistress!
CYMBELINE	PISANIO	How fares my mistress?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	The tune of Imogen!
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	New matter still?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	It poison'd me.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	What's this, Cornelius?
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	Most like I did, for I was dead.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	This is sure Fidele.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	[Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.
CYMBELINE	IMOGEN	I am sorry for't, my lord.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	I have spoke it, and I did it.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	He was a prince.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	In that he spake too far.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	And thou shalt die for't.
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Your danger's ours.
CYMBELINE	GUIDERIUS	And our good his.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Nursing of my sons?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	How? my issue?
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	Did you e'er meet?
CYMBELINE	ARVIRAGUS	Ay, my good lord.
CYMBELINE	CORNELIUS	By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Happy be you!
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Philarmonus!
CYMBELINE	SOOTHSAYER	Here, my good lord.
CYMBELINE	LUCIUS	Read, and declare the meaning.
CYMBELINE	CYMBELINE	This hath some seeming.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PORTER	What shall I say you are?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	LORD BARDOLPH	Here comes the Earl.                Exit PORTER
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	NORTHUMBERLAND	Good, an God will!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	LORD BARDOLPH	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	LORD BARDOLPH	This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water; but for the party that owed it, he might have moe diseases than he knew for.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent anything that intends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm'd all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann'd with an agate till now; but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master, for a jewel- the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face-royal. God may finish it when he will, 'tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Wait close; I will not see him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What's he that goes there?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	He that was in question for the robb'ry?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What, to York? Call him back again.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	Sir John Falstaff!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Boy, tell him I am deaf.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	Sir John!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	You mistake me, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you you in your throat, if you say I am any other than an honest man.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SERVANT	Sir, my lord would speak with you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship was sick; I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	An't please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return'd with some discomfort from Wales.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fall'n into this same whoreson apoplexy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Well God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, an't please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	It hath it original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen; it is a kind of deafness.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	I think you are fall'n into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears; and I care not if I do become your physician.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I would it were otherwise; I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	You have misled the youthful Prince.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	The young Prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal'd wound. Your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th' unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting that action.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a sleeping wolf.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	A wassail candle, my lord- all tallow; if I did say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	His effect of gravy, gravy,
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	You follow the young Prince up and down, like his ill angel.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light; but  hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing. And yet in some respects, I grant, I cannot go- I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers' times that true valour is turn'd berod; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young; you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, must confess, are wags too.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice- I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him. For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you- he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check'd him for it; and the young lion repents- marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Well, God send the Prince a better companion!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	God send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid my hands of him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day, and I brandish anything but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever; but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your expedition!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man can no more separate age and covetousness than 'a can part young limbs and lechery; but the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Sir?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What money is in my purse?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Seven groats and two pence.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HASTINGS	With him, we may.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	LORD BARDOLPH	What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	LORD BARDOLPH	Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	Shall we go draw our numbers, and set on?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Master Fang, have you ent'red the action?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	It is ent'red.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? Will 'a stand to't?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	Sirrah, where's Snare?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SNARE	Here, here.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Yea, good Master Snare; I have ent'red him and all.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SNARE	It may chance cost some of our lives, for he will stab.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabb'd me in mine own house, and that most beastly. In good faith, 'a cares not what mischief he does, if his weapon be out; he will foin like any devil; he will spare neither man, woman, nor child.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	No, nor I neither; I'll be at your elbow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	An I but fist him once; an 'a come but within my vice!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	How now! whose mare's dead? What's the matter?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph. Cut me off the villian's head. Throw the quean in the channel.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Keep them off, Bardolph.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FANG	A rescue! a rescue!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wot, wot thou! thou wot, wot ta? Do, do, thou rogue! do, thou hemp-seed!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What is the matter? Keep the peace here, ho!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	O My most worshipful lord, an't please your Grace, I am a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	For what sum?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all- all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home; he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his. But I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee a nights like a mare.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have any vantage of ground to get up.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! What man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good case, and, the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practis'd upon the easy yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Yea, in truth, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villainy you have done with her; the one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty rememb'red, I will not be your suitor. I say to you I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King's affairs.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	You speak as having power to do wrong; but answer in th' effect of your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Now, Master Gower, what news?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Faith, you said so before.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman! Come, no more words of it.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking; and for thy walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the Prodigal, or the German hunting, in water-work, is worth a thousand of these bed-hangers and these fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou canst. Come, and 'twere not for thy humours, there's not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face, and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in this humour with me; dost not know me? Come, come, I know thou wast set on to this.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles; i' faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me, la!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Let it alone; I'll make other shift. You'll be a fool still.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Will I live?  [To BARDOLPH]  Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	I have heard better news.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What's the news, my lord?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Where lay the King to-night?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	GOWER	At Basingstoke, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I hope, my lord, all's well. What is the news, my lord?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Come all his forces back?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Comes the King back from Wales, my noble lord?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	What's the matter?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool that taught them me. This is the right fencing grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Before God, I am exceeding weary.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attach'd one of so high blood.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Faith, it does me; though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Belike then my appetite was not-princely got; for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face to-morrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast- viz., these, and those that were thy peach-colour'd ones- or to bear the inventory of thy shirts- as, one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault; whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily strengthened.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick; albeit I could tell to thee- as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend- I could be sad and sad indeed too.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Very hardly upon such a subject.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	The reason?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	It would be every man's thought; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine. Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	And to thee.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	God save your Grace!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	And yours, most noble Bardolph!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	'A calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his eyes; and methought he had made two holes in the alewife's new petticoat, and so peep'd through.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Has not the boy profited?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand; and therefore I call him her dream.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	An you do not make him be hang'd among you, the gallows shall have wrong.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Deliver'd with good respect. And how doth the martlemas, your master?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	In bodily health, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but that moves not him. Though that be sick, it dies not.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my dog; and he holds his place, for look you how he writes.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight'- Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself, even like those that are kin to the King; for they never prick their finger but they say 'There's some of the King's blood spilt.' 'How comes that?' says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap: 'I am the King's poor cousin, sir.'
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Why, this is a certificate.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Peace!  [Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity.'-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Yea, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	What company?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Sup any women with him?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	What pagan may that be?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	I have no tongue, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at his table as drawers.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FRANCIS	What the devil hast thou brought there-apple-johns? Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	THIRD DRAWER	Dispatch! The room where they supp'd is too hot; they'll come in straight.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FRANCIS	Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John must not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	THIRD DRAWER	By the mass, here will be old uds; it will be an excellent stratagem.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine, and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's this?' How do you now?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Better than I was- hem.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	[Singing]  'When Arthur first in court'- Empty the jordan.  [Exit FRANCIS]- [Singing]  'And was a worthy king'- How now, Mistress Doll!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	So is all her sect; and they be once in a calm, they are sick.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	A pox damn you, you muddy rascal! Is that all the comfort you give me?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	I make them! Gluttony and diseases make them: I make them not.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to make the diseases, Doll. We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue, grant that.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	'Your brooches, pearls, and ouches.' For to serve bravely is to come halting off; you know, to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely; to venture upon the charg'd chambers bravely-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never meet but you fall to some discord. You are both, i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What the good-year! one must bear, and that must be you. You are the weaker vessel, as as they say, the emptier vessel.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FRANCIS	Sir, Ancient Pistol's below and would speak with you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come hither; it is the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by my faith! I must live among my neighbours; I'll no swaggerers. I am in good name and fame with the very best. Shut the door. There comes no swaggerers here; I have not liv'd all this while to have swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, hostess?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John; there comes no swaggerers here.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my house, nor no cheater; but I do not love swaggering, by my troth. I am the worse when one says 'swagger.' Feel, masters, how I shake; look you, I warrant you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	So you do, hostess.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	God save you, Sir John!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack; do you discharge upon mine hostess.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	She is pistol-proof, sir; you shall not hardly offend her.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I'll drink no more than will do me good, for no man's pleasure, I.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for your master.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	God let me not live but I will murder your ruff for this.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	No, good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Captain! Thou abominable damn'd cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for taking their names upon you before you have earn'd them. You a captain! you slave, for what? For tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a captain! hang him, rogue! He lives upon mouldy stew'd prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's light, these villains will make the word as odious as the word 'occupy'; which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted. Therefore captains had need look to't.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Pray thee go down, good ancient.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Not I! I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could tear her; I'll be reveng'd of her.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	Pray thee go down.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i' faith; I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	By my troth, Captain, these are very bitter words.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Be gone, good ancient; this will grow to a brawl anon.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren here?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	O' my word, Captain, there's none such here. What the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For God's sake, be quiet.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Pistol, I would be quiet.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What! we have seen the seven stars.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	For God's sake thrust him down stairs; I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Thrust him down stairs! Know we not Galloway nags?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Come, get you down stairs.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Here's goodly stuff toward!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Give me my rapier, boy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone. Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Have you turn'd him out a doors?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk. You have hurt him, sir, i' th' shoulder.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	A rascal! to brave me!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PAGE	The music is come, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Don. A rascal bragging slave! The rogue fled from me like quick-silver.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Peace, good Doll! Do not speak like a death's-head; do not bid me remember mine end.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Sirrah, what humour's the Prince of?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	A good shallow young fellow. 'A would have made a good pantler; 'a would ha' chipp'd bread well.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	They say Poins has a good wit.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Why does the Prince love him so, then?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Because their legs are both of a bigness, and 'a plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild mare with the boys, and jumps upon join'd-stools, and swears with a good grace, and wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories; and such other gambol faculties 'a has, that show a weak mind and an able body, for the which the Prince admits him. For the Prince himself is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Let's beat him before his whore.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Look whe'er the wither'd elder hath not his poll claw'd like a parrot.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Kiss me, Doll.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says th' almanac to that?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	And look whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book, his counsel-keeper.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Thou dost give me flattering busses.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I am old, I am old.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young boy of them all.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Some sack, Francis.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE & POINS	Anon, anon, sir.                   [Advancing]
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Ha! a bastard son of the King's? And art thou not Poins his brother?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a life dost thou lead!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	A better than thou. I am a gentleman: thou art a drawer.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	How, you fat fool! I scorn you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	YOU whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is, by my troth.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Didst thou hear me?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse, and then I know how to handle you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour; no abuse.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Not- to dispraise me, and call me pander, and bread-chipper, and I know not what!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	No abuse!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Ned, i' th' world; honest Ned, none. I disprais'd him before the wicked- that the wicked might not fall in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject; and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys, none.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us? Is she of the wicked? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is thy boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	POINS	Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	The fiend hath prick'd down Bardolph irrecoverable; and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy- there is a good angel about him; but the devil outbids him too.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	For the women?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	For one of them- she's in hell already, and burns poor souls. For th' other- I owe her money; and whether she be damn'd for that, I know not.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	No, I warrant you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	All vict'lers do so. What's a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	You, gentlewoman-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	What says your Grace?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Peto, how now! What news?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	[To the PAGE]. Pay the musicians, sirrah.- Farewell, hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches, how men of merit are sought after; the undeserver may sleep, when the man of action is call'd on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent away post, I will see you again ere I go.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	[ Within]  Mistress Tearsheet!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	What's the matter?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	[ Within]  Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Many good morrows to your Majesty!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Is it good morrow, lords?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	'Tis one o'clock, and past.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	We have, my liege.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, sir; give me your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	And how doth my cousin, your bed-fellow? and your fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	By yea and no, sir. I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar; he is at Oxford still, is he not?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Indeed, sir, to my cost.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	You were call'd 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	We shall all follow, cousin.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	By my troth, I was not there.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Dead, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Thereafter as they be- a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Here come two of Sir John Falstaffs men, as I think.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Good morrow, honest gentlemen.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	I beseech you, which is Justice Shallow?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county, and one of the King's justices of the peace. What is your good pleasure with me?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of the peace.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	Your good worship is welcome.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Fie! this is hot weather. Gentlemen, have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Let me see them, I beseech you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Where's the roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so, so, so,- so, so- yea, marry, sir. Rafe Mouldy! Let them appear as I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me see; where is Mouldy?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOULDY	Here, an't please you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	What think you, Sir John? A good-limb'd fellow; young, strong, and of good friends.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Is thy name Mouldy?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOULDY	Yea, an't please you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	'Tis the more time thou wert us'd.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Prick him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOULDY	I was prick'd well enough before, an you could have let me alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery. You need not to have prick'd me; there are other men fitter to go out than I.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Go to; peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is time you were spent.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOULDY	Spent!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under. He's like to be a cold soldier.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Where's Shadow?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHADOW	Here, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Shadow, whose son art thou?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHADOW	My mother's son, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Do you like him, Sir John?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Shadow will serve for summer. Prick him; for we have a number of shadows fill up the muster-book.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Thomas Wart!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Where's he?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WART	Here, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Is thy name Wart?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WART	Yea, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Thou art a very ragged wart.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Shall I prick him, Sir John?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir; you can do it. I commend you well. Francis Feeble!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	Here, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What trade art thou, Feeble?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	A woman's tailor, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Shall I prick him, sir?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	You may; but if he had been a man's tailor, he'd ha' prick'd you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	I would Wart might have gone, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private soldier, that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	It shall suffice, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Peter Bullcalf o' th' green!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BULLCALF	Here, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf till he roar again.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BULLCALF	O Lord! good my lord captain-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What, dost thou roar before thou art prick'd?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BULLCALF	O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What disease hast thou?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BULLCALF	A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught with ringing in the King's affairs upon his coronation day, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will have away thy cold; and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Here is two more call'd than your number. You must have but four here, sir; and so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George's Field?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	No more of that, Master Shallow, no more of that.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Ha, 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	She lives, Master Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	She never could away with me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	By the mass, I could anger her to th' heart. She was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Old, old, Master Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old; certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork, by old Nightwork, before I came to Clement's Inn.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	That's fifty-five year ago.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BULLCALF	Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend; and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hang'd, sir, as go. And yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care; but rather because I am unwilling and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my friends; else, sir, I did not care for mine own part so much.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOULDY	And, good Master Corporal Captain, for my old dame's sake, stand my friend. She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone; and she is old, and cannot help herself. You shall have forty, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FEEBLE	By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death. I'll ne'er bear a base mind. An't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so. No man's too good to serve 's Prince; and, let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Well said; th'art a good fellow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Come, sir, which men shall I have?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Four of which you please.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Sir, a word with you. I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Go to; well.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Do you choose for me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Marry, then- Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, and Shadow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service; and for your part, Bullcalf, grow you come unto it. I will none of you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong. They are your likeliest men, and I would have you serv'd with the best.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Hold, Wart. Traverse- thus, thus, thus.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Fore God, would you would.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	What is this forest call'd
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HASTINGS	'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your Grace.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HASTINGS	We have sent forth already.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HASTINGS	Now, what news?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	My lord, we will do so.          Exit WESTMORELAND
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	Your Grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	I take your princely word for these redresses.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	I do not doubt you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	The word of peace is rend'red. Hark, how they shout!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	This had been cheerful after victory.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	MOWBRAY	Is this proceeding just and honourable?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WESTMORELAND	Is your assembly so?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	ARCHBISHOP	Will you thus break your faith?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What's your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and of what place, I pray?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	COLVILLE	I am a knight sir; and my name is Colville of the Dale.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Well then, Colville is your name, a knight is your degree, and your place the Dale. Colville shall still be your name, a traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place- a place deep enough; so shall you be still Colville of the Dale.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	COLVILLE	Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do you yield, sir, or shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they weep for thy death; therefore rouse up fear and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	COLVILLE	I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I know not. Here he is, and here I yield him; and I beseech your Grace, let it be book'd with the rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own picture on the top on't, Colville kissing my foot; to the which course if I be enforc'd, if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me, and I, in the clear sky of fame, o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element, which show like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Thine's too heavy to mount.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Let it shine, then.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Thine's too thick to shine.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me good, and call it what you will.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Is thy name Colville?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	COLVILLE	It is, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	A famous rebel art thou, Colville.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	And a famous true subject took him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Now, have you left pursuit?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WESTMORELAND	Retreat is made, and execution stay'd.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	The army is discharged all and gone.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	And how accompanied?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	I do not know, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	What would my lord and father?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	I shall observe him with all care and love.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	With Poins, and other his continual followers.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	Comfort, your Majesty!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	O my royal father!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WESTMORELAND	My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Speak lower, Princes, for the King recovers.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	This apoplexy will certain be his end.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Call for the music in the other room.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	I am here, brother, full of heaviness.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	Exceeding ill.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	He alt'red much upon the hearing it.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	Let us withdraw into the other room.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Will't please your Grace to go along with us?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CLARENCE	Doth the King call?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	This door is open; he is gone this way.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE HUMPHREY	He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	I never thought to hear you speak again.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Health, peace, and happiness, to my royal father!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE	My Lord of Warwick!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	Here, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served; and, again, sir- shall we sow the headland with wheat?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook- are there no young pigeons?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and plough-irons.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Let it be cast, and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had; and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	'A shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legg'd hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Yea, Davy; I will use him well. A friend i' th' court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves and will backbite.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they have marvellous foul linen.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Well conceited, Davy- about thy business, Davy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of Woncot against Clement Perkes o' th' hill.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his friend's request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave is not. I have serv'd your worship truly, sir, this eight years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I beseech you, let him be countenanc'd.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about,
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	[Exit DAVY]  Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	I am glad to see your worship.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	[Within]  Sir John!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	How now, my Lord Chief Justice; whither away?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	How doth the King?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	I hope, not dead.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	WARWICK	Indeed, I think the young king loves you not.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE	Good morrow, cousin.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BROTHERS	We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we will eat a last year's pippin of mine own graffing, with a dish of caraways, and so forth. Come, cousin Silence. And then to bed.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and rich.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	This Davy serves you for good uses; he is your serving-man and your husband.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll give you a health for that anon.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Give Master Bardolph some wine, Davy.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Be merry, Master Bardolph; and, my little soldier there, be merry.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	[To BARDOLPH]  There's a dish of leather-coats for you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Davy!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Well said, Master Silence.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	An we shall be merry, now comes in the sweet o' th' night.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Health and long life to you, Master Silence!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Honest Bardolph, welcome; if thou want'st anything and wilt not call, beshrew thy heart. Welcome, my little tiny thief and welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cabileros about London.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	I hope to see London once ere I die.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	An I might see you there, Davy!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	By the mass, you'R crack a quart together- ha! will you not, Master Bardolph?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	By God's liggens, I thank thee. The knave will stick by thee, I can assure thee that. 'A will not out, 'a; 'tis true bred.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	BARDOLPH	And I'll stick by him, sir.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	[To SILENCE, who has drunk a bumper]  Why, now you have done me right.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	'Tis so.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DAVY	An't please your worship, there's one Pistol come from the court with news.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Sir John, God save you!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What wind blew you hither, Pistol?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	By'r lady, I think 'a be, but goodman Puff of Barson.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SILENCE	[Singing]  And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Why, then, lament therefore.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Give me pardon, sir. If, sir, you come with news from the court, I take it there's but two ways- either to utter them or conceal them. I am, sir, under the King, in some authority.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or die.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Under King Harry.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	Harry the Fourth- or Fifth?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Harry the Fourth.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	What, is the old king dead?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	As nail in door. The things I speak are just.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land, 'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	What, I do bring good news?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might die, that I might have thee hang'd. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FIRST BEADLE	The constables have delivered her over to me; and she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant her. There hath been a man or two lately kill'd about her.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I'll tell thee what, thou damn'd tripe-visag'd rascal, an the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou paper-fac'd villain.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	O the Lord, that Sir John were come! He would make this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FIRST BEADLE	If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I will have you as soundly swing'd for this- you blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famish'd correctioner, if you be not swing'd, I'll forswear half-kirtles.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FIRST BEADLE	Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Ay, come, you starv'd bloodhound.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Goodman death, goodman bones!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	HOSTESS	Thou atomy, thou!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	DOLL	Come, you thin thing! come, you rascal!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FIRST GROOM	More rushes, more rushes!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SECOND GROOM	The trumpets have sounded twice.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	God bless thy lungs, good knight!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	It doth so.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	It shows my earnestness of affection-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	It doth so.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My devotion-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	It doth, it doth, it doth.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	As it were, to ride day and night; and not to deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to shift me-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	It is best, certain.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with desire to see him; thinking of nothing else, putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	'Tis 'semper idem' for 'obsque hoc nihil est.' 'Tis all in every part.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	'Tis so, indeed.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	God save thy Grace, King Hal; my royal Hal!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PISTOL	The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	God save thee, my sweet boy!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	KING	My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you speak?
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me have home with me.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet that shall make you great.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	I cannot perceive how, unless you give me your doublet, and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was but a colour.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	SHALLOW	A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	FALSTAFF	My lord, my lord-
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	And so they are.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	PRINCE JOHN	The King hath call'd his parliament, my lord.
SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV	CHIEF JUSTICE	He hath.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	EXETER	Not here in presence.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Send for him, good uncle.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WESTMORELAND	Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	May I with right and conscience make this claim?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	What treasure, uncle?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	EXETER	Tennis-balls, my liege.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	EXETER	This was a merry message.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Well met, Corporal Nym.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	For my part, I care not; I say little, but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles- but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is a simple one; but what though? It will toast cheese, and it will endure cold as another man's sword will; and there's an end.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I will do as I may. That is my rest, that is the rendezvous of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife. Good Corporal, be patient here.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	How now, mine host Pistol!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight. [Nym draws] O well-a-day, Lady, if he be not drawn! Now we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Good Lieutenant, good Corporal, offer nothing here.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Pish!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	I am not Barbason: you cannot conjure me. I have an humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms; if you would walk off I would prick your guts a little, in good terms, as I may, and thaes the humour of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	I will cut thy throat one time or other, in fair terms; that is the humour of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Away, you rogue.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days: the King has kill'd his heart. Good husband, come home presently.                            Exeunt HOSTESS and BOY
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to France together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Base is the slave that pays.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	That now I will have; that's the humour of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill him; by this sword, I will.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends; an thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me too. Prithee put up.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	[Sheathing his sword] I shall have my noble?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	In cash most justly paid.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	The King hath run bad humours on the knight; that's the even of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	The King is a good king, but it must be as it may; he passes some humours and careers.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BEDFORD	Fore God, his Grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	EXETER	They shall be apprehended by and by.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	SCROOP	No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	O, let us yet be merciful!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CAMBRIDGE	So may your Highness, and yet punish too.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	SCROOP	So did you me, my liege.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GREY	And I, my royal sovereign.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GREY, SCROOP	To which we all appeal.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in heaven or in hell!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	They say he cried out of sack.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	Ay, that 'a did.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	And of women.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	Nay, that 'a did not.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	Yes, that 'a did, and said they were devils incarnate.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	'A could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	'A said once the devil would have him about women.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	HOSTESS	'A did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was rheumatic, and talk'd of the Whore of Babylon.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	Do you not remember 'a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose, and 'a said it was a black soul burning in hell?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Well, the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's all the riches I got in his service.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Shall we shog? The King will be gone from Southampton.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	And that's but unwholesome food, they say.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Touch her soft mouth and march.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	Farewell, hostess.                     [Kissing her]
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Let housewifery appear; keep close, I thee command.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	From our brother of England?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	Or else what follows?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BARDOLPH	On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	NYM	Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is too hot; that is the very plain-song of it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	Would I were in an alehouse in London! I wouid give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman- a very vallant gentleman, i' faith.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	I think it be.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	JAMY	I say gud day, Captain Fluellen.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	How now, Captain Macmorris! Have you quit the mines? Have the pioneers given o'er?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MACMORRIS	By Chrish, la, tish ill done! The work ish give over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give over; I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, tish ill done, tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument, look you, and friendly communication; partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the point.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	JAMY	It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath; and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick occasion; that sall I, marry.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	JAMY	By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or I'll lig i' th' grund for it; ay, or go to death. And I'll pay't as valorously as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full fain heard some question 'tween you tway.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation-
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MACMORRIS	Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	JAMY	Ah! that's a foul fault.              [A parley sounded]
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	The town sounds a parley.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Un peu, madame.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Je te prie, m'enseignez; il faut que j'apprenne a parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglais?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	La main? Elle est appelee de hand.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	De hand. Et les doigts?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me souviendrai. Les doigts? Je pense qu'ils sont appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Les ongles? Nous les appelons de nails.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi si je parle bien: de hand, de fingres, et de nails.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglais.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Dites-moi l'Anglais pour le bras.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	De arm, madame.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Et le coude?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	D'elbow.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	D'elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Excusez-moi, Alice; ecoutez: d'hand, de fingre, de nails, d'arma, de bilbow.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	D'elbow, madame.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	De nick, madame.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	De nick. Et le menton?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	De chin.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	De sin. Le col, de nick; le menton, de sin.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Oui. Sauf votre honneur, en verite, vous prononcez les mots aussi droit que les natifs d'Angleterre.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Je ne doute point d'apprendre, par la grace de Dieu, et en peu de temps.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Non, je reciterai a vous promptement: d'hand, de fingre, de mails-
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	De nails, madame.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	De nails, de arm, de ilbow.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Sauf votre honneur, d'elbow.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Ainsi dis-je; d'elbow, de nick, et de sin. Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Le foot, madame; et le count.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Le foot et le count. O Seigneur Dieu! ils sont mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde. Foh! le foot et le count! Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble: d'hand, de fingre, de nails, d'arm, d'elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, le count.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Excellent, madame!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	How now, Captain Fluellen! Come you from the bridge?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	I assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my live, and my living, and my uttermost power. He is not- God be praised and blessed!- any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is man of no estimation in the world; but I did see him do as gallant service.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	What do you call him?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	He is call'd Aunchient Pistol.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Here is the man.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at his hands.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Why then, rejoice therefore.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Certainly, Aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	It is well.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	The fig of Spain!                                 Exit
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Very good.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I remember him now- a bawd, a cutpurse.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	I'll assure you, 'a utt'red as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Why, 'tis a gull a fool a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself, at his return into London, under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names; and they will learn you by rote where services were done- at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tuned oaths; and what a beard of the General's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-wash'd wits is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvellously mistook.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	How now, Fluellen! Cam'st thou from the bridge?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintain'd the pridge; the French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th' athversary was have possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge; I can tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	What men have you lost, Fluellen!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great; marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church- one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man; his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire; and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red; but his nose is executed and his fire's out.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MONTJOY	You know me by my habit.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Well then, I know thee; what shall I know of thee?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MONTJOY	My master's mind.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Unfold it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	What is thy name? I know thy quality.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MONTJOY	Montjoy.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MONTJOY	I shall deliver so. Thanks to your Highness.     Exit
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GLOUCESTER	I hope they will not come upon us now.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	It is the best horse of Europe.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Will it never be morning?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armour?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him; he is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	No more, cousin.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the world- familiar to us and unknown- to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: 'Wonder of nature'-
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser; for my horse is my mistress.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Your mistress bears well.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Me well; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	So perhaps did yours.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Mine was not bridled.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	O, then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off and in your strait strossers.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	You have good judgment in horsemanship.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Be warn'd by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my mistress.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to my mistress.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et la truie lavee au bourbier.' Thou mak'st use of anything.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	RAMBURES	My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent to-night- are those stars or suns upon it?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Stars, my lord.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	And yet my sky shall not want.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and 'twere more honour some were away.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Ev'n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and my way shall be paved with English faces.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I will not say so, for fear I should be fac'd out of my way; but I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	RAMBURES	Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.               Exit
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	The Dauphin longs for morning.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	RAMBURES	He longs to eat the English.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I think he will eat all he kills.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	He never did harm that I heard of.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	I know him to be valiant.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I was told that by one that knows him better than you.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	What's he?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he car'd not who knew it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Ill-wind never said well.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Well plac'd! There stands your friend for the devil; have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of the devil!'
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A fool's bolt is soon shot.'
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	You have shot over.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MESSENGER	My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Who hath measur'd the ground?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MESSENGER	The Lord Grandpre.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	RAMBURES	That island of England breeds very valiant creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear, and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples! You may as well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Just, just! and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives; and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel; they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to eat, and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we about it?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GLOUCESTER	We shall, my liege.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ERPINGHAM	Shall I attend your Grace?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Qui va la?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	A friend.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I am a gentleman of a company.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Even so. What are you?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	As good a gentleman as the Emperor.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Then you are a better than the King.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Harry le Roy.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Le Roy! a Cornish name; art thou of Cornish crew?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	No, I am a Welshman.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Know'st thou Fluellen?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Yes.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Art thou his friend?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	And his kinsman too.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	The figo for thee, then!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I thank you; God be with you!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	My name is Pistol call'd.                         Exit
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Captain Fluellen!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	If the enemy is an ass, and a fool, and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass, and a fool, and a prating coxcomb? In your own conscience, now?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GOWER	I will speak lower.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	COURT	Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks yonder?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	A friend.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Under what captain serve you?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	A good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Even as men wreck'd upon a sand, that look to be wash'd off the next tide.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	He hath not told his thought to the King?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man as I am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions; his ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	He may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this, to feel other men's minds; methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's company, his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	That's more than we know.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough if we know we are the King's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads, chopp'd off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at such a place'- some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head- the King is not to answer for it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BATES	I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'd.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are cut he may be ransom'd, and we ne'er the wiser.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	You pay him then! That's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun, that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch! You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word after! Come, 'tis a foolish saying.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Your reproof is something too round; I should be angry with you, if the time were convenient.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Let it be a quarrel between us if you live.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I embrace it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	How shall I know thee again?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet; then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it, I will make it my quarrel.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Here's my glove; give me another of thine.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	There.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	This will I also wear in my cap; if ever thou come to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,' by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Thou dar'st as well be hang'd.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the King's company.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WILLIAMS	Keep thy word. Fare thee well.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ERPINGHAM	I shall do't, my lord.                         Exit
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GLOUCESTER	My liege!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Montez a cheval! My horse! Varlet, laquais! Ha!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	O brave spirit!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	DAUPHIN	Via! Les eaux et la terre-
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ORLEANS	Rien puis? L'air et le feu.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	Hark how our steeds for present service neigh!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MESSENGER	The English are embattl'd, you French peers.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	CONSTABLE	They have said their prayers and they stay for death.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	GLOUCESTER	Where is the King?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BEDFORD	The King himself is rode to view their battle.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WESTMORELAND	Of fighting men they have full three-score thousand.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	EXETER	There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BEDFORD	Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	All things are ready, if our minds be so.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	WESTMORELAND	Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Who hath sent thee now?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	MONTJOY	The Constable of France.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Yield, cur!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	Je pense que vous etes le gentilhomme de bonne qualite.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	O Seigneur Dieu!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	O, prenez misericorde; ayez pitie de moi!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	O, pardonnez-moi!
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	Monsieur le Fer.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	He says his name is Master Fer.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	PISTOL	Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH SOLDIER	Que dit-il, monsieur?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BOY	Il me commande a vous dire que vous faites vous pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette heure de couper votre gorge.

If any man challenge this, he is a friend to Alencon and an enemy to our person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FLUELLEN	Your Grace does me as great honours as can be desir'd in the hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that has but two legs that shall find himself aggrief'd at this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an please God of his grace that I might see.

Will you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour, and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel; you find it otherwise, and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition. Fare ye well.                                Exit

THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to affirm it.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men are full of deceits?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits- dat is de Princess.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	I cannot tell vat is dat.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Sauf votre honneur, le Francais que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l'Anglais lequel je parle.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	I cannot tell.

THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KATHERINE	Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Madame my interpreter, what says she?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Dat it is not be de fashion pour le ladies of France- I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	To kiss.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Your Majestee entendre bettre que moi.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	ALICE	Oui, vraiment.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her; and that is good English.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BURGUNDY	Is she not apt?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BURGUNDY	Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet ros'd over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BURGUNDY	They are then excus'd, my lord, when they see not what they do.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BURGUNDY	I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning; for maids well summer'd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes; and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	BURGUNDY	As love is, my lord, before it loves.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never ent'red.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Shall Kate be my wife?
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	So please you.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her; so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	FRENCH KING	We have consented to all terms of reason.
THE LIFE OF KING HENRY THE FIFTH	KING HENRY	Is't so, my lords of England?

THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	VERNON	Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	BASSET	Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	LUCY	O, send some succour to the distress'd lord!
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	How now, Sir William! Whither were you sent?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	If he be dead, brave Talbot, then, adieu!
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Fly to revenge my death, if I be slain.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	He that flies so will ne'er return again.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Upon my blessing I command thee go.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Part of thy father may be sav'd in thee.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	No part of him but will be shame in me.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	Yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	TALBOT	Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SERVANT	O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	CHARLES	On what submissive message art thou sent?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	CHARLES	Go, take their bodies hence.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	How doth your Grace affect their motion?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	LEGATE	I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	CHARLES	What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	PUCELLE	Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Fell banning hag; enchantress, hold thy tongue.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	PUCELLE	I prithee give me leave to curse awhile.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	Why speak'st thou not? What ransom must I pay?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	Wilt thou accept of ransom-yea or no?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	I were best leave him, for he will not hear.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	[Aside]  There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	[Aside]  And yet a dispensation may be had.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	And yet I would that you would answer me.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	Hear ye, Captain-are you not at leisure?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	[Aside]  Tush! women have been captivate ere now.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Lady, wherefore talk you so?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	What?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	His love.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	MARGARET	An if my father please, I am content.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	REIGNIER	To whom?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	To me.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	REIGNIER	Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	And this withal.                         [Kisses her]
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Ay, ay. Away with her to execution!
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Now heaven forfend! The holy maid with child!
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	A married man! That's most intolerable.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
THE FIRST PART OF HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	How say'st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	[Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	We thank you all.                            [Flourish]
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Uncle, how now!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	And so says York- [Aside] for he hath greatest cause.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	Then let's make haste away and look unto the main.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HUME	Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DUCHESS	What say'st thou? Majesty! I am but Grace.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST PETITIONER	My masters, let's stand close; my Lord Protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND PETITIONER	Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	How now, fellow! Wouldst anything with me?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	[Reads] 'To my Lord Protector!' Are your supplications to his lordship? Let me see them. What is thine?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND PETITIONER	Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PETER	[Presenting his petition] Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	What say'st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PETER	That my master was? No, forsooth. My master said that he was, and that the King was an usurper.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	Come, let's be gone.                               Exeunt
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	The Cardinal's not my better in the field.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Warwick may live to be the best of all.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Peace, headstrong Warwick!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	What mean'st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Say, man, were these thy words?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HORNER	An't shall please your Majesty, I never said nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I am falsely accus'd by the villain.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	I humbly thank your royal Majesty.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HORNER	And I accept the combat willingly.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, or you must fight or else be hang'd.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HUME	Come, my masters; the Duchess, I tell you, expects performance of your promises.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BOLINGBROKE	Master Hume, we are therefore provided; will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HUME	Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DUCHESS	Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this gear, the sooner the better.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SPIRIT	Adsum.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SPIRIT	Ask what thou wilt; that I had said and done.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BOLINGBROKE	[Reads] 'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BOLINGBROKE	'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SPIRIT	By water shall he die and take his end.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BOLINGBROKE	'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	The treasury of everlasting joy!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	As who, my lord?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	And thy ambition, Gloucester.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would 'twere come to that!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Marry, when thou dar'st.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	How now, my lords!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	True, uncle.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advis'd? The east side of the grove?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	TOWNSMAN	A miracle! A miracle!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Come to the King, and tell him what miracle.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Born blind, an't please your Grace.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	Ay indeed was he.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	What woman is this?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	His wife, an't like your worship.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Where wert thou born?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	At Berwick in the north, an't like your Grace.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	What, art thou lame?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Ay, God Almighty help me!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	How cam'st thou so?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	A fall off of a tree.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	A plum tree, master.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	How long hast thou been blind?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	O, born so, master!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	What, and wouldst climb a tree?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Mass, thou lov'dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Red, master; red as blood.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Black, forsooth; coal-black as jet.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	But cloaks and gowns before this day a many.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	Never before this day in all his life.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Alas, master, I know not.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	What's his name?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	I know not.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Nor his?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	No, indeed, master.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	What's thine own name?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIMPCOX	O master, that you could!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	My masters of Saint Albans, have you not beadles in your town, and things call'd whips?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MAYOR	Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Then send for one presently.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. [A stool brought] Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and run away.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BEADLE	I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet quickly.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	It made me laugh to see the villain run.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Follow the knave, and take this drab away.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WIFE	Alas, sir, we did it for pure need!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	My lord, I long to hear it at full.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BOTH	Long live our sovereign Richard, England's King!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DUCHESS	Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST NEIGHBOUR	Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of sack; and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND NEIGHBOUR	And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	THIRD NEIGHBOUR	And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour; drink, and fear not your man.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HORNER	Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and a fig for Peter!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST PRENTICE	Here, Peter, I drink to thee; and be not afraid.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND PRENTICE	Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight for credit of the prentices.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PETER	I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you; for I think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my apron; and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer; and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O Lord bless me, I pray God! for I am never able to deal with my master, he hath learnt so much fence already.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PETER	Peter, forsooth.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	Peter? What more?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PETER	Thump.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	Thump? Then see thou thump thy master well.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HORNER	Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have at thee with a down right blow!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in thy master's way.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SERVING-MAN	Ten, my lord.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SERVING-MAN	So please your Grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	No, stir not for your lives; let her pass by.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	STANLEY	So am I given in charge, may't please your Grace.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DUCHESS	What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SHERIFF	It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	All health unto my gracious sovereign!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	I say no more than truth, so help me God!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	But I can give the loser leave to chide.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CARDINAL	Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	What, will your Highness leave the Parliament?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	So that, by this, you would not have him die.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	And so say I.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	What, worse than nought? Nay, then a shame take all!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	And in the number, thee that wishest shame!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST MURDERER	Here comes my lord.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST MURDERER	Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST MURDERER	'Tis, my good lord.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	I'll call him presently, my noble lord.          Exit
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Marry, God forfend!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	He doth revive again; madam, be patient.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING	O heavenly God!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	How fares my gracious lord?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	COMMONS	[Within] An answer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	COMMONS	[Within] An answer from the King, or we will all break in!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	I go.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	And take my heart with thee.           [She kisses him]
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	See how the pangs of death do make him grin
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	What is my ransom, master, let me know?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MASTER	A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MATE	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	I'll give it, sir: and therefore spare my life.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	And so will I, and write home for it straight.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WHITMORE	The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WHITMORE	Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Thou dar'st not, for thy own.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	Poole!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Poole?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	Walter-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WHITMORE	Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SUFFOLK	Gelidus timor occupat artus: it is thee I fear.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LIEUTENANT	Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Come and get thee a sword, though made of a lath; they have been up these two days.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	They have the more need to sleep now, then.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Nay, more, the King's Council are no good workmen.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	True; and yet it is said 'Labour in thy vocation'; which is as much to say as 'Let the magistrates be labouring men'; and therefore should we be magistrates.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's leather of.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	And Dick the butcher-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Then is sin struck down, like an ox, and iniquity's throat cut like a calf.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	And Smith the weaver-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Argo, their thread of life is spun.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	We John Cade, so term'd of our supposed father-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with the spirit of putting down kings and princes- command silence.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Silence!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	My father was a Mortimer-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] He was an honest man and a good bricklayer.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	My mother a Plantagenet-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] I knew her well; she was a midwife.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	My wife descended of the Lacies-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] She was, indeed, a pedlar's daughter, and sold many laces.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	[Aside] But now of late, not able to travel with her furr'd pack, she washes bucks here at home.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Therefore am I of an honourable house.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable, and there was he born, under a hedge, for his father had never a house but the cage.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Valiant I am.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	[Aside] 'A must needs; for beggary is valiant.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	I am able to endure much.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] No question of that; for I have seen him whipt three market days together.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	I fear neither sword nor fire.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	[Aside] He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	[Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being burnt i' th' hand for stealing of sheep.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	God save your Majesty!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	I thank you, good people- there shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers and worship me their lord.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	The clerk of Chatham. He can write and read and cast accompt.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	O monstrous!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	We took him setting of boys' copies.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Here's a villain!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Nay, then he is a conjurer.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Nay, he can make obligations and write court-hand.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLERK	Emmanuel.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	They use to write it on the top of letters; 'twill go hard with you.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name, or hast thou a mark to thyself, like a honest plain-dealing man?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLERK	Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up that I can write my name.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	He hath confess'd. Away with him! He's a villain and a traitor.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MICHAEL	Where's our General?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Here I am, thou particular fellow.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MICHAEL	Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by, with the King's forces.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He shall be encount'red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight, is 'a?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MICHAEL	No.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	And Adam was a gardener.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WILLIAM STAFFORD	And what of that?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	STAFFORD	Ay, sir.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	By her he had two children at one birth.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WILLIAM STAFFORD	That's false.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WILLIAM STAFFORD	Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	And furthermore, we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	And good reason; for thereby is England main'd and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French, and therefore he is a traitor.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	STAFFORD	O gross and miserable ignorance!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Nay, answer if you can; the Frenchmen are our enemies. Go to, then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor, or no?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	They are all in order, and march toward us.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Here, sir.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house; therefore thus will I reward thee- the Lent shall be as long again as it is, and thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	I desire no more.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the gaols and let out the prisoners.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	What answer makes your Grace to the rebels' supplication?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	Ay, but I hope your Highness shall have his.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	How now! What news? Why com'st thou in such haste?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	O graceless men! they know not what they do.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	Then linger not, my lord; away, take horse.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Come Margaret; God, our hope, will succour us.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceas'd.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	[To LORD SAY] Farewell, my lord, trust not the Kentish rebels.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SCALES	How now! Is Jack Cade slain?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOLDIER	Jack Cade! Jack Cade!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Knock him down there.                    [They kill him]
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	My lord, there's an army gathered together in Smithfield.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	I have a suit unto your lordship.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	[Aside] Mass, 'twill be sore law then; for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole yet.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SMITH	[Aside] Nay, John, it will be stinking law; for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	JOHN	[Aside] Then we are like to have biting statutes, unless his teeth be pull'd out.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	What of that?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Marry, thou ought'st not to let thy horse wear a cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	And work in their shirt too, as myself, for example, that am a butcher.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	You men of Kent-
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	What say you of Kent?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	Nothing but this: 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Away with him, away with him! He speaks Latin.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	O monstrous coward! What, to come behind folks?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Give him a box o' th' ear, and that will make 'em red again.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Ye shall have a hempen caudle then, and the help of hatchet.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	Why dost thou quiver, man?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SAY	The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	[Aside] I feel remorse in myself with his words; but I'll bridle it. He shall die, an it be but for pleading so well for his life.- Away with him! He has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o' God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike off his head presently, and then break into his son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	It shall be done.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	DICK	My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside, and take up commodities upon our bills?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Marry, presently.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	God save the King! God save the King!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	A Clifford! a Clifford! We'll follow the King and Clifford.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me desolate. I see them lay their heads together to surprise me. My sword make way for me for here is no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have through the very middest of you! and heavens and honour be witness that no want of resolution in me, but only my followers' base and ignominious treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	Health and glad tidings to your Majesty!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave. Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach'd, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days, yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door-nail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CADE	Iden, farewell; and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.                                        [Dies]
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	York, if thou meanest well I greet thee well.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BUCKINGHAM	Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	IDEN	I was, an't like your Majesty.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Will you not, sons?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SALISBURY	I have.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YOUNG CLIFFORD	Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Of one or both of us the time is come.
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	My soul and body on the action both!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	La fin couronne les oeuvres.                  [Dies]
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN	Away, my lord! You are slow; for shame, away!
THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	I wonder how the King escap'd our hands.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORFOLK	Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORFOLK	We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	I am thine.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Whom should he follow but his natural king?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	It must and shall be so; content thyself.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Sons, peace!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	'Twas by rebellion against his king.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	What then?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	My conscience tells me he is lawful King.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	[Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	What good is this to England and himself!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WESTMORELAND	Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WESTMORELAND	I cannot stay to hear these articles.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	Nor I.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Ah, Exeter!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Why should you sigh, my lord?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORFOLK	And I to Norfolk with my followers.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Exeter, so will I.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	No, I can better play the orator.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	No quarrel, but a slight contention.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	About what?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Your right depends not on his life or death.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	I shall be, if I claim by open war.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SIR JOHN	She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	YORK	What, with five thousand men?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	TUTOR	And I, my lord, will bear him company.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Soldiers, away with him!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RUTLAND	I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Thy father hath.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RUTLAND	Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	So doth the cony struggle in the net.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	What would your Grace have done unto him now?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	That is my office, for my father's sake.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	How now! what news?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	Be it with resolution, then, to fight.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	You said so much before, and yet you fled.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	NORTHUMBERLAND	No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLIFFORD	I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Stay, Edward.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SON	Was ever son so rued a father's death?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FATHER	Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RICHARD	Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EDWARD	Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GEORGE	Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST KEEPER	Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	But did you never swear, and break an oath?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND KEEPER	Here in this country, where we now remain.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST KEEPER	We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he keeps the wind!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take vantages.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of her.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather give her two.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Three, my most gracious lord.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	[Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	And would you not do much to do them good?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	To do them good I would sustain some harm.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Therefore I came unto your Majesty.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	What service wilt thou do me if I give them?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	What you command that rests in me to do.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	But you will take exceptions to my boon.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	But now you partly may perceive my mind.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LADY GREY	'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	You'd think it strange if I should marry her.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	To who, my lord?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Why, Clarence, to myself.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	By so much is the wonder in extremes.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Injurious Margaret!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PRINCE OF WALES	And why not Queen?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	And I the house of York.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	But is he gracious in the people's eye?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	The more that Henry was unfortunate.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PRINCE OF WALES	To Edward, but not to the English king.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	LEWIS	Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	BONA	My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	And his well-chosen bride.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MONTAGUE	But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MONTAGUE	So God help Montague as he proves true!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HASTINGS	And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	Fear not that, my lord.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND WATCHMAN	What, will he not to bed?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST WATCHMAN	'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SECOND WATCHMAN	'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST WATCHMAN	Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST WATCHMAN	Who goes there?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	What are they that fly there?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RIVERS	Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RIVERS	What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, but the loss of his own royal person.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RIVERS	Then is my sovereign slain?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	RIVERS	But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HUNTSMAN	This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	But whither shall we then?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HASTINGS	To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HUNTSMAN	Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	And I choose Clarence only for Protector.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	What else? And that succession be determin'd.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	What news, my friend?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MAYOR	True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	HASTINGS	Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	ALL	Long live Edward the Fourth!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Let's levy men and beat him back again.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING HENRY	Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	MONTAGUE	Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	OXFORD	[Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid adieu.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	EXETER	The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	FIRST MESSENGER	By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The gates are open, let us enter too.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	WARWICK	O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	SOMERSET	But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	OXFORD	For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	PRINCE OF WALES	Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	O, kill me too!
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Why should she live to fill the world with words?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	What? what?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	QUEEN MARGARET	Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	CLARENCE	Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Where's Richard gone?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Think'st thou I am an executioner?
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	GLOUCESTER	Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH	KING EDWARD	Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BUCKINGHAM	O, you go far!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BUCKINGHAM	I pray you, who, my lord?

KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Say not treasonous.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Faith, and so it did.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BRANDON	Your office, sergeant: execute it.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BRANDON	A monk o' th' Chartreux.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BUCKINGHAM	O, Nicholas Hopkins?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BRANDON	He.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	QUEEN KATHARINE	Nay, we must longer kneel: I am suitor.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Lady mine, proceed.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Speak freely.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	What was that Henton?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	How know'st thou this?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURVEYOR	I can, my liege.

KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	What is't for?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	LOVELL	Faith, how easy?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SANDYS	As easy as a down bed would afford it.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	Was he mad, sir?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	You cannot show me.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	What's that?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	Look out there, some of ye.             Exit a SERVANT
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	How now! what is't?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	My lord!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	Your Grace?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	What say they?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	LOVELL	Yes, my lord.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	I fear, too much.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Whither away so fast?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Were you there?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Yes, indeed, was I.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Pray, speak what has happen'd.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	You may guess quickly what.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Is he found guilty?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	I am sorry for't.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	So are a number more.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	But, pray, how pass'd it?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	After all this, how did he bear him-self
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	I do not think he fears death.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Let's stand close, and behold him.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	Good day to both your Graces.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	How is the King employ'd?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	What's the cause?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	And free us from his slavery.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Who's there, ha?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Pray God he be not angry.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]  We are busy; go.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	[Aside to SUFFOLK]  This priest has no pride in him!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Come hither, Gardiner.                   [Walks and whispers]
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Yes, he was.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAMPEIUS	Was he not held a learned man?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Yes, surely.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	How! Of me?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	Nay, good troth.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	OLD LADY	Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a queen!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	No, not for all the riches under heaven.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	No, in truth.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	Now, I pray God, amen!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	This is strange to me.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ANNE	Come, you are pleasant.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Be't so; proceed.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SCRIBE	Say 'Henry King of England, come into the court.'
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRIER	Henry King of England, &c.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Here.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SCRIBE	Say 'Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.'

KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Call her again.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRIER	Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GENTLEMAN USHER	Madam, you are call'd back.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	LINCOLN	Very well, my liege.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	QUEEN KATHARINE	How now?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	QUEEN KATHARINE	Would they speak with me?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GENTLEMAN	They will'd me say so, madam.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Peace to your Highness!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenis-sima-
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	QUEEN KATHARINE	How, sir?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	He tells you rightly.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAMPEIUS	Your rage mistakes us.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAMPEIUS	Your fears are worse.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Pray hear me.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	Most Strangely.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	O, how, how?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	Has the King this?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	Believe it.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	Will this work?

KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Observe, observe, he's moody.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	Look'd he o' th' inside of the paper?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	I think by this he is.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	He's discontented.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	The King, the King!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	You have said well.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	[Aside]  What should this mean?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	The King, that gave it.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	It must be himself then.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	I forgive him.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	I have no power to speak, sir.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	How does your Grace?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	God bless him!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	WOLSEY	That's news indeed.

KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	So are you.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	'Tis the same-High Steward.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	And that my Lord of Norfolk?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Yes.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	It is; and all the rest are countesses.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	THIRD GENTLEMAN	That I did.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	FIRST GENTLEMAN	How was it?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	THIRD GENTLEMAN	Well worth the seeing.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Good sir, speak it to us.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	But what follow'd?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Who may that be, I pray you?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SECOND GENTLEMAN	He will deserve more.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GRIFFITH	How does your Grace?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KATHARINE	Alas, poor man!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GRIFFITH	Madam, we are here.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GRIFFITH	None, madam.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GRIFFITH	She is going, wench. Pray, pray.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	MESSENGER	An't like your Grace-
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAPUCIUS	Madam, the same-your servant.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAPUCIUS	Madam, in good health.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PATIENCE	No, madam.                       [Giving it to KATHARINE]
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CAPUCIUS	Most willing, madam.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BOY	It hath struck.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	LOVELL	Came you from the King, my lord?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SUFFOLK	Sir, I did never win of you before.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Alas, good lady!
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Ha! Canterbury?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	DENNY	Ay, my good lord.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	'Tis true. Where is he, Denny?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	DENNY	He attends your Highness' pleasure.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Bring him to us.                                   Exit DENNY
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GENTLEMAN	[Within]  Come back; what mean you?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	LOVELL	Sir?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the Queen.            Exit
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRANMER	Why?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRANMER	So.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BUTTS	I'll show your Grace the strangest sight-
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	What's that, Butts?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	BUTTS	I think your Highness saw this many a day.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Body a me, where is it?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	Has he had knowledge of it?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	Yes.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	NORFOLK	Who waits there?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KEEPER	Without, my noble lords?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	Yes.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHANCELLOR	Let him come in.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	Why, my lord?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	Not sound?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	Not sound, I say.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	I shall remember this bold language.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	GARDINER	I have done.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CROMWELL	And I.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	ALL	We are.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CHAMBERLAIN	This is the King's ring.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	'Tis no counterfeit.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	SURREY	May it please your Grace-
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PORTER	Belong to th' gallows, and be hang'd, ye rogue! Is this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves, and strong ones; these are but switches to 'em. I'll scratch your heads. You must be seeing christenings? Do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PORTER	How got they in, and be hang'd?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PORTER	You did nothing, sir.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	MAN	What would you have me do?
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PORTER	What should you do, but knock 'em down by th' dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a thousand: here will be father, godfather, and all together.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	PORTER	Make way there for the Princess.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRANMER	Elizabeth.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	CRANMER	Amen.
KING HENRY THE EIGHTH	KING	Thou speakest wonders.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
KING JOHN	ELINOR	A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	What follows if we disallow of this?
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Our strong possession and our right for us!
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	What art thou?
KING JOHN	ROBERT	The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Our country manners give our betters way.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	What is thy name?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
KING JOHN	GURNEY	Good leave, good Philip.
KING JOHN	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	As faithfully as I deny the devil.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Excuse it is to beat usurping down.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	Let me make answer: thy usurping son.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Peace!
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Hear the crier.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	What the devil art thou?
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Come to thy grandam, child.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Bedlam, have done.
KING JOHN	CITIZEN	Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	'Tis France, for England.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Bastards and else.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	To verify our title with their lives.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	As many and as well-born bloods as those-
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Some bastards too.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Amen, Amen! Mount, chevaliers; to arms!
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Peace! no more.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar!
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Speed then to take advantage of the field.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
KING JOHN	CITIZEN	The King of England, when we know the King.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Know him in us that here hold up his right.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	I from the north.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	What say'st thou, boy? Look in the lady's face.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
KING JOHN	LEWIS	She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	I do beseech you, madam, be content.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Lady Constance, peace!
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	O that a man should speak those words to me!
KING JOHN	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Look'st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Your breeches best may carry them.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal?
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	What should he say, but as the Cardinal?
KING JOHN	BLANCH	That's the curse of Rome.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	The King is mov'd, and answers not to this.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	O be remov'd from him, and answer well!
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	I am perplex'd and know not what to say.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
KING JOHN	AUSTRIA	Rebellion, flat rebellion!
KING JOHN	LEWIS	Father, to arms!
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	I will denounce a curse upon his head.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	O fair return of banish'd majesty!
KING JOHN	ELINOR	O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
KING JOHN	LEWIS	Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
KING JOHN	BLANCH	There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	O, this will make my mother die with grief!
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Farewell, gentle cousin.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	I am much bounden to your Majesty.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Death.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	My lord?
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	A grave.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	He shall not live.
KING JOHN	ELINOR	My blessing go with thee!
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	Lo now! now see the issue of your peace!
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Patience, good lady! Comfort, gentle Constance!
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	O fair affliction, peace!
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	To England, if you will.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	Bind up your hairs.
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
KING JOHN	CONSTANCE	He talks to me that never had a son.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	You are as fond of grief as of your child.
KING JOHN	KING PHILIP	I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.         Exit
KING JOHN	LEWIS	All days of glory, joy, and happiness.
KING JOHN	LEWIS	As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
KING JOHN	LEWIS	But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
KING JOHN	LEWIS	And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
KING JOHN	EXECUTIONER	I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	Good morrow, Hubert.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Good morrow, little Prince.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Indeed I have been merrier.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Young boy, I must.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	And will you?
KING JOHN	HUBERT	And I will.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Come, boy, prepare yourself.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	Is there no remedy?
KING JOHN	HUBERT	None, but to lose your eyes.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	I can heat it, boy.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
KING JOHN	ARTHUR	O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
KING JOHN	MESSENGER	Under the Dauphin.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
KING JOHN	PETER	Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	I Will seek them out.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
KING JOHN	MESSENGER	With all my heart, my liege.                        Exit
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Five moons!
KING JOHN	HUBERT	No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	My lord-
KING JOHN	PEMBROKE	Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?
KING JOHN	BIGOT	To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
KING JOHN	PEMBROKE	Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	'Tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	This is the prison. What is he lies here?
KING JOHN	HUBERT	I am no villain.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Must I rob the law?                  [Drawing his sword]
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
KING JOHN	BIGOT	Out, dunghill! Dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Thou art a murderer.
KING JOHN	PEMBROKE	Cut him to pieces.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Keep the peace, I say.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Lord Bigot, I am none.
KING JOHN	BIGOT	Who kill'd this prince?
KING JOHN	BIGOT	Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Do but hear me, sir.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Upon my soul-
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	That villain Hubert told me he did live.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Have thou the ordering of this present time.
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	You look but on the outside of this work.
KING JOHN	PANDULPH	Give me leave to speak.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	No, I will speak.
KING JOHN	LEWIS	Strike up our drums to find this danger out.
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?
KING JOHN	KING JOHN	Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.
KING JOHN	MELUN	Lead me to the revolts of England here.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	When we were happy we had other names.
KING JOHN	PEMBROKE	It is the Count Melun.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	Wounded to death.
KING JOHN	SALISBURY	May this be possible? May this be true?
KING JOHN	MESSENGER	Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
KING JOHN	LEWIS	Here; what news?
KING JOHN	MESSENGER	Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Who's there? Speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	A friend. What art thou?
KING JOHN	HUBERT	Of the part of England.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Whither dost thou go?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Hubert, I think.
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Brief, then; and what's the news?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	How did he take it; who did taste to him?
KING JOHN	BASTARD	Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?
KING JOHN	PRINCE HENRY	How fares your Majesty?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST COMMONER	Why, sir, a carpenter.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MARULLUS	But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MARULLUS	What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet, if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MARULLUS	What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	Why, sir, cobble you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FLAVIUS	Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but with awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND COMMONER	Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Calpurnia!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Calpurnia!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CALPURNIA	Here, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Caesar, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Set on, and leave no ceremony out.           Flourish.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SOOTHSAYER	Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Ha! Who calls?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SOOTHSAYER	Beware the ides of March.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	What man is that?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Set him before me let me see his face.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SOOTHSAYER	Beware the ides of March.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Will you go see the order of the course?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Not I.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I pray you, do.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	The games are done, and Caesar is returning.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Antonio!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Caesar?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Why, for that too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Why, for that too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Who offered him the crown?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Why, Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	What said he when he came unto himself?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, ""Alas, good soul!"" and forgave him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less."
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	And after that he came, thus sad, away?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Did Cicero say anything?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	To what effect?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	No, I am promised forth.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Will you dine with me tomorrow?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Good, I will expect you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CICERO	Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Who's there?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	A Roman.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Casca, by your voice.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	A very pleasing night to honest men.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	Call'd you, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I will, my lord.                                 Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I know not, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Look in the calendar and bring me word.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I will, sir.                                     Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Is he alone?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	No, sir, there are more with him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Do you know them?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	He is welcome hither.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DECIUS	Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	No.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	No, by no means.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Then leave him out.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DECIUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Peace, count the clock.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	Here is a sick man that would speak with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CALPURNIA	Say he is sick.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	And this way have you well expounded it.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PUBLIUS	Good morrow,Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	So to most noble Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	To know my errand, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I hear none, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SOOTHSAYER	At mine own house, good lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PORTIA	What is't o'clock?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SOOTHSAYER	About the ninth hour, lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PORTIA	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PORTIA	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PORTIA	Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	The ides of March are come.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise today may thrive.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	He is address'd; press near and second him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	What, Brutus?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	O Caesar-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DECIUS	Great Caesar-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CAESAR	Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DECIUS	And Cassius too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Where is Antony?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DECIUS	What, shall we forth?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Mark Antony-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I like it not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	I do, Mark Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CITIZENS	We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	I will hear Brutus speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	None, Brutus, none.

THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Let him be Caesar.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	My countrymen-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Peace, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	What does he say of Brutus?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	This Caesar was a tyrant.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	You gentle Romans-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Peace, ho! Let us hear him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	They were traitors. Honorable men!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	The will! The testament!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Come down.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	You shall have leave.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	A ring, stand round.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Stand back; room, bear back!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	O piteous spectacle!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	O noble Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	O woeful day!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	O traitors villains!

THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	We'll mutiny.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	We'll burn the house of Brutus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	O royal Caesar!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Hear me with patience.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ALL	Peace, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Go fetch fire.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Pluck down benches.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Where is he?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SERVANT	He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	What is your name?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Whither are you going?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Where do you dwell?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	Are you a married man or a bachelor?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	Answer every man directly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Ay, and briefly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	Ay, and wisely.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Ay, and truly, you were best.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	As a friend or an enemy?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	As a friend.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND CITIZEN	That matter is answered directly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	For your dwelling, briefly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD CITIZEN	Your name, sir, truly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	Truly, my name is Cinna.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST CITIZEN	Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CINNA	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FOURTH CITIZEN	It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LEPIDUS	I do consent-
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Prick him down, Antony.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LEPIDUS	What, shall I find you here?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Stand, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCILIUS	Give the word, ho, and stand.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Stand, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST SOLDIER	Stand!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND SOLDIER	Stand!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	THIRD SOLDIER	Stand!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Chastisement?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Go to, you are not, Cassius.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I am.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I say you are not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Away, slight man!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Is't possible?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Is it come to this?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	If you did, I care not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I durst not?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	No.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	What, durst not tempt him?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	For your life you durst not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I denied you not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	You did.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I do not, till you practise them on me.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	You love me not.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	I do not like your faults.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	A friendly eye could never see such faults.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	And my heart too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	O Brutus!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCILIUS	[Within.] You shall not come to them.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	How now, what's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I did not think you could have been so angry.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Ha? Portia?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	She is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	And died so?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Even so.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Portia, art thou gone?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	With what addition?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Cicero one!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	No, Messala.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Nothing, Messala.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	That, methinks, is strange.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	No, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Even so great men great losses should endure.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	I do not think it good.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Your reason?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Hear me, good brother.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Everything is well.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Good night, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Good night, good brother.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	Here in the tent.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VARRO	Calls my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VARRO	So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	Ay, my lord, an't please you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	It is my duty, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	I have slept, my lord, already.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	GHOST	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Why comest thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	GHOST	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Well, then I shall see thee again?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	GHOST	Ay, at Philippi.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	The strings, my lord, are false.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	LUCIUS	Nothing, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VARRO	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLAUDIO	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VARRO	CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Ay, saw you anything?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VARRO	No, my lord, I saw nothing.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLAUDIO	Nor I, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Why do you cross me in this exigent?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	They stand, and would have parley.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Stir not until the signal not until the signal.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Not that we love words better, as you do.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Not stingless too.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Old Cassius still!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	Messala!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	[Stands forth.] What says my general?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Believe not so.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Even so, Lucilius.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	They are, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	PINDARUS	[Above.] O my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CASSIUS	What news?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	These tidings would well comfort Cassius.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Where did you leave him?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	He lies not like the living. O my heart!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Is not that he?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	TITINIUS	What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CATO	He is slain.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST SOLDIER	Yield, or thou diest.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	FIRST SOLDIER	We must not. A noble prisoner!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	SECOND SOLDIER	Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	ANTONY	Where is he?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Peace then, no words.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	I'll rather kill myself.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DARDANIUS	Shall I do such a deed?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	O Dardanius!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DARDANIUS	O Clitus!
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	DARDANIUS	To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	BRUTUS	Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VOLUMNIUS	What says my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	VOLUMNIUS	Not so, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	CLITUS	Fly, my lord, fly.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	STRATO	Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	What man is that?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	STRATO	Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	OCTAVIUS	Do so, good Messala.
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	MESSALA	How died my master, Strato?
THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR	STRATO	I held the sword, and he did run on it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Why, that to know which else we should not know.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	How well he's read, to reason against reading!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	The spring is near, when green geese are a-breeding.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	How follows that?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Fit in his place and time.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	In reason nothing.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Something then in rhyme.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Well, sit out; go home, Berowne; adieu.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	[Reads] 'Item. That no woman shall come within a mile of my court'- Hath this been proclaimed?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Four days ago.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Let's see the penalty. [Reads] '-on pain of losing her tongue.' Who devis'd this penalty?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Marry, that did I.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Sweet lord, and why?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Which is the Duke's own person?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	This, fellow. What wouldst?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his Grace's farborough; but I would see his own person in flesh and blood.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	This is he.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Signior Arme- Arme- commends you. There's villainy abroad; this letter will tell you more.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	A letter from the magnificent Armado.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	A high hope for a low heaven. God grant us patience!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	To hear, or forbear hearing?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or, to forbear both.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	In what manner?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	In manner and form following, sir; all those three: I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with her upon the form, and taken following her into the park; which, put together, is in manner and form following. Now, sir, for the manner- it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman. For the form- in some form.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	For the following, sir?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	As it shall follow in my correction; and God defend the right!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Will you hear this letter with attention?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	As we would hear an oracle.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god and body's fost'ring patron'-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Not a word of Costard yet.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	[Reads] 'So it is'-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	It may be so; but if he say it is so, he is, in telling true, but so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Peace!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Be to me, and every man that dares not fight!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	No words!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured melancholy, I did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to walk. The time When? About the sixth hour; when beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper. So much for the time When. Now for the ground Which? which, I mean, I upon; it is ycleped thy park. Then for the place Where? where, I mean, I did encounter that obscene and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink which here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest. But to the place Where? It standeth north-north-east and by east from the west corner of thy curious-knotted garden. There did I see that low-spirited swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Me?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Me?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	'that shallow vassal,'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Still me?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	O, me!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon; which, with, O, with- but with this I passion to say wherewith-'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Me, an't shall please you; I am Antony Dull.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	This is not so well as I look'd for, but the best that ever I heard.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say you to this?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Sir, I confess the wench.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Did you hear the proclamation?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I do confess much of the hearing it, but little of the marking of it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment to be taken with a wench.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I was taken with none, sir; I was taken with a damsel.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Well, it was proclaimed damsel.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	This was no damsel neither, sir; she was a virgin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	It is so varied too, for it was proclaimed virgin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	If it were, I deny her virginity; I was taken with a maid.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	This 'maid' not serve your turn, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	This maid will serve my turn, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast a week with bran and water.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	No, no; O Lord, sir, no!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Why tough signior? Why tough signior?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	And I, tough signior, as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Pretty and apt.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or I apt, and my saying pretty?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Thou pretty, because little.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	And therefore apt, because quick.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Speak you this in my praise, master?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	In thy condign praise.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	I will praise an eel with the same praise.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	that an eel is ingenious?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	That an eel is quick.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat'st my blood.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	I am answer'd, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I love not to be cross'd.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary: crosses love not him.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I have promised to study three years with the Duke.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	You may do it in an hour, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Impossible.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	How many is one thrice told?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I am ill at reck'ning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I confess both; they are both the varnish of a complete man.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	It doth amount to one more than two.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Which the base vulgar do call three.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	True.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three studied ere ye'll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	A most fine figure!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	[Aside] To prove you a cipher.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devis'd curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should out-swear Cupid. Comfort me, boy; what great men have been in love?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Hercules, master.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter; and he was in love.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's love, my dear Moth?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A woman, master.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Of what complexion?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Tell me precisely of what complexion.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Of the sea-water green, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Is that one of the four complexions?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	My love is most immaculate white and red.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask'd under such colours.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Define, define, well-educated infant.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	My father's wit my mother's tongue assist me!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages since; but I think now 'tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	[Aside] To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I say, sing.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Sir, the Duke's pleasure is that you keep Costard safe; and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance; but 'a must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park; she is allow'd for the day-woman. Fare you well.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Man!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I will visit thee at the lodge.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	That's hereby.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I know where it is situate.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Lord, how wise you are!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I will tell thee wonders.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	With that face?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I love thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	So I heard you say.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	And so, farewell.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Fair weather after you!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Come, Jaquenetta, away.             Exit with JAQUENETTA
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be pardoned.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Thou shalt be heavily punished.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Take away this villain; shut him up.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Come, you transgressing slave, away.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	No, sir; that were fast, and loose. Thou shalt to prison.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	What shall some see?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Proud of employment, willingly I go.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	FIRST LORD	Lord Longaville is one.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Know you the man?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	They say so most that most his humours know.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Now, what admittance, lord?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	I will be welcome then; conduct me thither.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Our Lady help my lord! He'll be forsworn.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Why, will shall break it; will, and nothing else.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I know you did.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	How needless was it then to ask the question!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	You must not be so quick.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	'Tis long of you, that spur me with such questions.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Your wit 's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	What time o' day?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	The hour that fools should ask.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Now fair befall your mask!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Fair fall the face it covers!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	And send you many lovers!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Amen, so you be none.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Nay, then will I be gone.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Satisfy me so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I would you heard it groan.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Is the fool sick?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Sick at the heart.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Alack, let it blood.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Would that do it good?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	My physic says 'ay.'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Will YOU prick't with your eye?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	No point, with my knife.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Now, God save thy life!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	And yours from long living!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I cannot stay thanksgiving.                [Retiring]
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	A gallant lady! Monsieur, fare you well.          Exit
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Her mother's, I have heard.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	God's blessing on your beard!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Not unlike, sir; that may be.           Exit LONGAVILLE
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	What's her name in the cap?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Rosaline, by good hap.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Is she wedded or no?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	To her will, sir, or so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	You are welcome, sir; adieu!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	And every jest but a word.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	It was well done of you to take him at his word.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Two hot sheeps, marry!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	You sheep and I pasture- shall that finish the jest?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	So you grant pasture for me.     [Offering to kiss her]
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Belonging to whom?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	To my fortunes and me.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	With what?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	With that which we lovers entitle 'affected.'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Your reason?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Come, to our pavilion. Boyet is dispos'd.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Thou art an old love-monger, and speakest skilfully.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	He is Cupid's grandfather, and learns news of him.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Then was Venus like her mother; for her father is but grim.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Do you hear, my mad wenches?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	No.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	What, then; do you see?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Ay, our way to be gone.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither; I must employ him in a letter to my love.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	How hast thou purchased this experience?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	By my penny of observation.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	But O- but O-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	The hobby-horse is forgot.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Almost I had.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Negligent student! learn her by heart.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	By heart and in heart, boy.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	What wilt thou prove?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon the instant. By heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I am all these three.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	And three times as much more, and yet nothing at all.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A message well sympathiz'd- a horse to be ambassador for an ass.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	The way is but short; away.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	As swift as lead, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I say lead is slow.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Thump, then, and I flee.                            Exit
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and the word 'l'envoy' for a salve?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Do the wise think them other? Is not l'envoy a salve?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	A good l'envoy, ending in the goose; would you desire more?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	I will tell you sensibly.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	We will talk no more of this matter.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Till there be more matter in the shin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	O, Marry me to one Frances! I smell some l'envoy, some goose, in this.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	True, true; and now you will be my purgation, and let me loose.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this significant [giving a letter] to the country maid Jaquenetta; there is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.                  Exit
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	My good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	What is a remuneration?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I thank your worship. God be wi' you!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	When would you have it done, sir?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	This afternoon.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Thou knowest not what it is.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Why, villain, thou must know first.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	I know not; but I think it was not he.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	FORESTER	Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	FORESTER	Yes, madam, fair.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	FORESTER	Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	The thickest and the tallest.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	What's your will, sir? What's your will?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	I am much deceived but I remember the style.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I told you: my lord.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	To whom shouldst thou give it?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	From my lord to my lady.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	From which lord to which lady?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Who is the shooter? who is the shooter?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Shall I teach you to know?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Ay, my continent of beauty.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Well then, I am the shooter.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	And who is your deer?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	You Still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as touching the hit it?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	By my troth, most pleasant! How both did fit it!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	A mark marvellous well shot; for they both did hit it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Wide o' the bow-hand! I' faith, your hand is out.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Indeed, 'a must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	She's too hard for you at pricks, sir; challenge her to bowl.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of a good conscience.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven; and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra, the soil, the land, the earth.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least; but, sir, I assure ye it was a buck of the first head.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of explication; facere, as it were, replication, or rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his inclination, after his undressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather unlettered, or ratherest unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my haud credo for a deer.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	What is Dictynna?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	'Tis true, indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	God comfort thy capacity! I say th' allusion holds in the exchange.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	And I say the polusion holds in the exchange; for the moon is never but a month old; and I say, beside, that 'twas a pricket that the Princess kill'd.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer? And, to humour the ignorant, call the deer the Princess kill'd a pricket.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge, so it shall please you to abrogate scurrility.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	A rare talent!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	[Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourish'd in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners; for their sons are well tutor'd by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you. You are a good member of the commonwealth.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	God give you good morrow, Master Person.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Master Person, quasi pers-one. And if one should be pierc'd which is the one?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Marry, Master Schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Piercing a hogshead! A good lustre of conceit in a turf of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine; 'tis pretty; it is well.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Good Master Parson, be so good as read me this letter; it was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Ay, sir, and very learned.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	You find not the apostrophas, and so miss the accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why, indeed, 'Naso' but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin, was this directed to you?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Berowne, one of the strange queen's lords.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I will overglance the superscript: 'To the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party writing to the person written unto: 'Your Ladyship's in all desired employment, Berowne.' Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King; and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen's which accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King; it may concern much. Stay not thy compliment; I forgive thy duty. Adieu.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and, as a certain father saith-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Marvellous well for the pen.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned, neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I beseech your society.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is the happiness of life.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Ay me!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid; thou hast thump'd him with thy bird-bolt under the left pap. In faith, secrets!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Ay me, I am forsworn!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	In love, I hope; sweet fellowship in shame!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	One drunkard loves another of the name.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Am I the first that have been perjur'd so?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	O most divine Kate!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	O most profane coxcomb!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	By earth, she is not, corporal: there you lie.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	As upright as the cedar.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	As fair as day.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	O that I had my wish!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	And I had mine!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	And I mine too,.good Lord!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Amen, so I had mine! Is not that a good word?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	God bless the King!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	What present hast thou there?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Some certain treason.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	What makes treason here?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	JAQUENETTA	Of Costard.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Where hadst thou it?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	How now! What is in you? Why dost thou tear it?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	A toy, my liege, a toy! Your Grace needs not fear it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	What?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Hence, sirs, away.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	And since her time are colliers counted bright.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	But what of this? Are we not all in love?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Some salve for perjury.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Satis quod sufficit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	I praise God for you, sir. Your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without heresy. I did converse this quondam day with a companion of the King's who is intituled, nominated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Novi hominem tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Laus Deo, bone intelligo.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Videsne quis venit?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Video, et gaudeo.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	[To MOTH] Chirrah!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Quare 'chirrah,' not 'sirrah'?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Men of peace, well encount'red.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Most military sir, salutation.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	[Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast of languages and stol'n the scraps.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	O, they have liv'd long on the alms-basket of words. I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word, for thou are not so long by the head as honorificabilitudinitatibus; thou art easier swallowed than a flap-dragon.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Peace! the peal begins.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	[To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lett'red?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a, b, spelt backward with the horn on his head?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Quis, quis, thou consonant?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	The third of the five vowels, if You repeat them; or the fifth, if I.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I will repeat them: a, e, I-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	The sheep; the other two concludes it: o, U.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch, a quick venue of wit- snip, snap, quick and home. It rejoiceth my intellect. True wit!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Offer'd by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	What is the figure? What is the figure?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Horns.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Thou disputes like an infant; go whip thy gig.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about your infamy circum circa- a gig of a cuckold's horn.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy ginger-bread. Hold, there is the very remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	O, I smell false Latin; 'dunghill' for unguem.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the charge-house on the top of the mountain?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Or mons, the hill.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I do, sans question.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate the Princess at her pavilion, in the posteriors of this day; which the rude multitude call the afternoon.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable, for the afternoon. The word is well cull'd, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Joshua, yourself; myself, Alexander; this gallant gentleman, Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	An excellent device! So, if any of the audience hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules; now thou crushest the snake!' That is the way to make an offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	For the rest of the Worthies?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I will play three myself.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Thrice-worthy gentleman!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Shall I tell you a thing?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	We attend.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you, follow.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Via, goodman Dull! Thou has spoken no word all this while.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DULL	Nor understood none neither, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Allons! we will employ thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Madam, came nothing else along with that?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	You'll ne'er be friends with him: 'a kill'd your sister.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	A light condition in a beauty dark.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	We need more light to find your meaning out.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	So do not you; for you are a light wench.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Indeed, I weigh not you; and therefore light.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Anything like?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Beauteous as ink- a good conclusion.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Madam, this glove.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Did he not send you twain?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her Grace?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Thy news, Boyet?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	But what, but what, come they to visit us?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	But, in this changing, what is your intent?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	But shall we dance, if they desire us to't?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	All hail, the richest heauties on the earth!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Their eyes, villain, their eyes.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	True; out indeed.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Once to behold, rogue.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes- with your sun-beamed eyes-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MOTH	They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	What would you with the Princess?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	What would they, say they?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	She says you have it, and you may be gone.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Tell her we measure them by weary steps.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	She hears herself.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	You took the moon at full; but now she's changed.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Our ears vouchsafe it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	But your legs should do it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Why take we hands then?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	More measure of this measure; be not nice.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	We can afford no more at such a price.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Price you yourselves. What buys your company?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Your absence only.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	That can never be.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	In private then.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	I am best pleas'd with that.       [They converse apart]
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	One word in secret.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Let it not be sweet.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Thou grievest my gall.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Gall! bitter.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Therefore meet.                 [They converse apart]
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Name it.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Fair lady-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	O for your reason! Quickly, sir; I long.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	A calf, fair lady!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	No, a fair lord calf.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Let's part the word.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	One word in private with you ere I die.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Berowne did swear himself out of all suit.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Qualm, perhaps.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Yes, in good faith.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Go, sickness as thou art!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	And Longaville was for my service born.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Will they return?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	How blow? how blow? Speak to be understood.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.          Exit
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Construe my speeches better, if you may.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	How, madam! Russians!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I am a fool, and full of poverty.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	O, I am yours, and all that I possess.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	All the fool mine?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	I cannot give you less.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Where? when? what vizard? Why demand you this?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	We were descried; they'll mock us now downright.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Let us confess, and turn it to a jest.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Amaz'd, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Sans 'sans,' I pray you.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Our states are forfeit; seek not to undo us.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Peace; for I will not have to do with you.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Madam, I was.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	And were you well advis'd?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	I was, fair madam.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	That more than all the world I did respect her.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Upon mine honour, no.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Despise me when I break this oath of mine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	What, are there but three?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	And three times thrice is nine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Is not nine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reck'ning, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	How much is it?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Art thou one of the Worthies?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great; for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy; but I am to stand for him.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Go, bid them prepare.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Berowne, they will shame us; let them not approach.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	I say they shall not come.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Doth this man serve God?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Why ask you?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	'A speaks not like a man of God his making.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	There is five in the first show.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	You are deceived, 'tis not so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I Pompey am-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	You lie, you are not he.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I Pompey am-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	With libbard's head on knee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Well said, old mocker; I must needs be friends with thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Great thanks, great Pompey.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands to right.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	NATHANIEL	When in the world I liv'd, I was the world's commander-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Most true, 'tis right, you were so, Alisander.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Pompey the Great!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Your servant, and Costard.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	A Judas!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	A kissing traitor. How art thou prov'd Judas?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Judas I am-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	The more shame for you, Judas!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	What mean you, sir?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	To make Judas hang himself.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	Begin, sir; you are my elder.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	I will not be put out of countenance.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Because thou hast no face.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	What is this?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	A cittern-head.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	The head of a bodkin.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	A death's face in a ring.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	The pommel of Coesar's falchion.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	The carv'd-bone face on a flask.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now, forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	You have put me out of countenance.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	False: we have given thee faces.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	But you have outfac'd them all.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	An thou wert a lion we would do so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	For the latter end of his name.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	For the ass to the Jude; give it him- Jud-as, away.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	HOLOFERNES	This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Hide thy head, Achilles; here comes Hector in arms.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	But is this Hector?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	I think Hector was not so clean-timber'd.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	His leg is too big for Hector's.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	More calf, certain.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	No; he is best indued in the small.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	This cannot be Hector.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	He's a god or a painter, for he makes faces.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	A gilt nutmeg.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	A lemon.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	Stuck with cloves.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	No, cloven.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	That mint.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	That columbine.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Speak, brave Hector; we are much delighted.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	[Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she is two months on her way.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	What meanest thou?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by him, and hang'd for Pompey that is dead by him.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Most rare Pompey!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BOYET	Renowned Pompey!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Hector trembles.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on! stir them on!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Hector will challenge him.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	Ay, if 'a have no more man's blood in his belly than will sup a flea.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I will not fight with a pole, like a Northern man; I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Room for the incensed Worthies!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	COSTARD	I'll do it in my shirt.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Most resolute Pompey!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my shirt.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	What reason have you for 't?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward for penance.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARCADE	God save you, madam!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Dead, for my life!
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARCADE	Even so; my tale is told.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	WOrthies away; the scene begins to cloud.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.                 Exeunt WORTHIES
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	How fares your Majesty?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Boyet, prepare; I will away to-night.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Madam, not so; I do beseech you stay.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	I understand you not; my griefs are double.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	So did our looks.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ROSALINE	We did not quote them so.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	BEROWNE	And what to me, my love? and what to me?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	O, shall I say I thank you, gentle wife?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KATHARINE	Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	What says Maria?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	LONGAVILLE	I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	MARIA	The liker you; few taller are so young.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	[ To the King] Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	PRINCESS OF FRANCE	Was not that not Hector?
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	DUMAIN	The worthy knight of Troy.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	ARMADO	I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a votary: I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year. But, most esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo? It should have followed in the end of our show.
LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST	KING	Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	That will be ere the set of sun.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Where the place?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Upon the heath.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	There to meet with Macbeth.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	I come, Graymalkin.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DUNCAN	O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross	
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	God save the King!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DUNCAN	Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DUNCAN	Great happiness!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	I'll see it done.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Where hast thou been, sister?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Killing swine.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	Sister, where thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	I'll give thee a wind.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Thou'rt kind.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	And I another.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Show me, show me.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Speak, if you can. What are you?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Hail!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Hail!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	Hail!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Not so happy, yet much happier.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Your children shall be kings.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	You shall be King.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	What, can the devil speak true?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	Look, how our partner's rapt.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	Very gladly.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DUNCAN	My worthy Cawdor!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MESSENGER	The King comes here tonight.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	And when goes hence?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Tomorrow, as he purposes.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	We will speak further.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Hath he ask'd for me?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Know you not he has?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	If we should fail?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	How goes the night, boy?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FLEANCE	The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	And she goes down at twelve.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FLEANCE	I take't 'tis later, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	A friend.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	At your kind'st leisure.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Good repose the while.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	[Within.] Who's there' what, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	When?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Now.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	As I descended?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Donalbain.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	This is a sorry sight.           [Looks on his hands.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	There are two lodged together.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Consider it not so deeply.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	What do you mean?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	PORTER	Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	What three things does drink especially provoke?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	PORTER	Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	PORTER	That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Good morrow, noble sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	morrow, both.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Not yet.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	I'll bring you to him.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Goes the King hence today?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	He does; he did appoint so.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	'Twas a rough fight.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	LENNOX. What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	What is't you say? the life?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Mean you his Majesty?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DONALBAIN	What is amiss?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Wherefore did you so?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Help me hence, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Look to the lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	And so do I.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ALL	So all.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	OLD MAN	'Tis said they eat each other.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Why, see you not?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Those that Macbeth hath slain.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Where is Duncan's body?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Will you to Scone?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Well, I will thither.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Farewell, father.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Here's our chief guest.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Ride you this afternoon?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	Ay, my good lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Fail not our feast.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	My lord, I will not.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon 's.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ATTENDANT	They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	It was, so please your Highness.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	You made it known to us.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	We are men, my liege.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BOTH MURTHERERS	True, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	Though our lives-
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BOTH MURTHERERS	We are resolved, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Is Banquo gone from court?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SERVANT	Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SERVANT	Madam, I will.                                  Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	You must leave this.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	What's to be done?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	But who did bid thee join with us?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD MURTHERER	Macbeth.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD MURTHERER	Hark! I hear horses.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	[Within.] Give us a light there, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	His horses go about.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD MURTHERER	'Tis he.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	Stand to't.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	BANQUO	It will be rain tonight.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD MURTHERER	Who did strike out the light?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	Wast not the way?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD MURTHERER	There's but one down; the son is fled.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LORDS	Thanks to your Majesty.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MURTHERER	'Tis Banquo's then.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MURTHERER	My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	The table's full.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Here is a place reserved, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Where?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your Highness?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Which of you have done this?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LORDS	What, my good lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	What, quite unmann'd in folly?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	If I stand here, I saw him.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Fie, for shame!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	What sights, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Did you send to him, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Sent he to Macduff?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	"Harpier cries, ""'Tis time, 'tis time."""
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ALL	A deed without a name.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Demand.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD WITCH	We'll answer.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Call 'em, let me see 'em.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Tell me, thou unknown power-
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND APPARITION	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ALL	Listen, but speak not to't.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ALL	Seek to know no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST WITCH	Show!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SECOND WITCH	Show!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	THIRD	WITCH. Show!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	What's your Grace's will?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Saw you the weird sisters?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	No, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Came they not by you?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	No indeed, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Fled to England?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LENNOX	Ay, my good lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	What had he done, to make him fly the land?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	You must have patience, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	As birds do, Mother.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	What, with worms and flies?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Nay, how will you do for a husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Was my father a traitor, Mother?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Ay, that he was.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	What is a traitor?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Why one that swears and lies.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	And be all traitors that do so?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Everyone.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Who must hang them?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Why, the honest men.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACDUFF	Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	Where is your husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	FIRST MURTHERER	He's a traitor.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SON	Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	I am not treacherous.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	I have lost my hopes.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	What should he be?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	O Scotland, Scotland!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	I thank you, Doctor.                     Exit Doctor.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	What's the disease he means?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	See, who comes here?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	My countryman, but yet I know him not.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Sir, amen.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Stands Scotland where it did?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	What's the newest grief?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	How does my wife?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Why, well.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	And all my children?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Well too.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Be not a niggard of your speech. How goest?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Humh! I guess at it.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	My children too?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	I have said.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	Dispute it like a man.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	That, sir, which I will not report after her.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	How came she by that light?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	You see, her eyes are open.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	Ay, but their sense is shut.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Yet here's a spot.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Do you mark that?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, will these hands neer be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Well, well, well-
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	Pray God it be, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	LADY MACBETH	Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Even so?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	DOCTOR	Will she go now to bed?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	GENTLEWOMAN	Directly.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	CAITHNESS	Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MENTEITH	What does the tyrant?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SERVANT	There is ten thousand-
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Geese, villain?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SERVANT	Soldiers, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SERVANT	The English force, so please you.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SEYTON	What's your gracious pleasure?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	What news more?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SEYTON	All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SEYTON	'Tis not needed yet.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MENTEITH	We doubt it nothing.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SIWARD	What wood is this before us?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MENTEITH	The Wood of Birnam.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SOLDIERS	It shall be done.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SEYTON	It is the cry of women, my good lord.            Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SEYTON	The Queen, my lord, is dead.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Well, say, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Liar and slave!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	YOUNG SIWARD	What is thy name?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	My name's Macbeth.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACBETH	No, nor more fearful.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MACDUFF	Turn, hell hound, turn!
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	MALCOLM	Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SIWARD	Then he is dead?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	SIWARD	Had he his hurts before?
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ROSS	Ay, on the front.
THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH	ALL	Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Escalus!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	My lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Look where he comes.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	The heavens give safety to your purposes!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I thank you. Fare you well.                         Exit
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Amen.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap'd one out of the table.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	'Thou shalt not steal'?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Ay, that he raz'd.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	I never heard any soldier dislike it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	No? A dozen times at least.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	What, in metre?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	In any proportion or in any language.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	I think, or in any religion.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	And thou the velvet; thou art good velvet; thou'rt a three-pil'd piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes! I have purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	To what, I pray?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Judge.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	To three thousand dolours a year.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Ay, and more.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	A French crown more.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Thou art always figuring diseases in me, but thou art full of error; I am sound.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Nay, not, as one would say, healthy; but so sound as things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast of thee.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. Well, well! there's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Who's that, I pray thee?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	Claudio to prison? 'Tis not so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested; saw him carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his head to be chopp'd off.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST GENTLEMAN	But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Yonder man is carried to prison.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. Well, what has he done?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	A woman.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. But what's his offence?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. What! is there a maid with child by him?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. What proclamation, man?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. And what shall become of those in the city?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	They shall stand for seed; they had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull'd down?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	To the ground, mistress.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. What's to do here, Thomas Tapster? Let's withdraw.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Why, how now, Claudio, whence comes this restraint?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	What but to speak of would offend again.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	What, is't murder?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	No.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Lechery?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Call it so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Away, sir; you must go.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	A hundred, if they'll do you any good. Is lechery so look'd after?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	With child, perhaps?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	I thank you, good friend Lucio.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Within two hours.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FRIAR	May your Grace speak of it?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FRIAR	Gladly, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	And have you nuns no farther privileges?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FRANCISCA	Are not these large enough?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[ Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Who's that which calls?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Woe me! For what?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Sir, make me not your story.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Is she your cousin?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	She it is.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	O, let him marry her!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Doth he so seek his life?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Assay the pow'r you have.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	My power, alas, I doubt!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	I'll see what I can do.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	But speedily.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I take my leave of you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Be it as your wisdom will.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Where is the Provost?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Here, if it like your honour.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	If it please your honour, I am the poor Duke's constable, and my name is Elbow; I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not malefactors?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	If it please your honour, I know not well what they are; but precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	What are you, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	He, sir? A tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they say, pluck'd down in the suburbs; and now she professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	How know you that?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	My Wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	How! thy wife!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Ay, sir; whom I thank heaven, is an honest woman-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Dost thou detest her therefore?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	How dost thou know that, constable?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accus'd in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	By the woman's means?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means; but as she spit in his face, so she defied him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable man, prove it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Do you hear how he misplaces?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, saving your honour's reverence, for stew'd prunes. Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of some three pence; your honours have seen such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very good dishes.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Go to, go to; no matter for the dish, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	No, indeed.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Very well; you being then, if you be rememb'red, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	Ay, so I did indeed.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be rememb'red, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	All this is true.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Why, very well then-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was done to Elbow's wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	No, sir, nor I mean it not.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	All-hallond eve.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	I have so; because it is an open room, and good for winter.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Why, very well then; I hope here be truths.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Once?- sir. There was nothing done to her once.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	I beseech your honour, ask me.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Ay, sir, very well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Nay, I beseech you, mark it well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Well, I do so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Why, no.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	I'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing about him. Good then; if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm? I would know that of your honour.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	He's in the right, constable; what say you to it?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	First, an it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his mistress is a respected woman.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicket varlet; the time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity? Is this true?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	If he took you a box o' th' ear, you might have your action of slander too.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou know'st what they are.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Where were you born, friend?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	Here in Vienna, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	Yes, an't please you, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	So. What trade are you of, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	A tapster, a poor widow's tapster.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Your mistress' name?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Mistress Overdone.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Hath she had any more than one husband?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FROTH	I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Pompey.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	What else?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Bum, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; so that, in the beastliest sense, you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you colour it in being a tapster. Are you not? Come, tell me true; it shall be the better for you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	How would you live, Pompey- by being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	If the law would allow it, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	No, Pompey.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: but it is but heading and hanging.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads; if this law hold in Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it, after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Seven year and a half, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it some time. You say seven years together?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	And a half, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Alas, it hath been great pains to you! They do you wrong to put you so oft upon't. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters; as they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some piece of money, and go through with all.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Look you, bring me in the names of some six or seven, the most sufficient of your parish.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	To your worship's house, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JUSTICE	Eleven, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I pray you home to dinner with me.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JUSTICE	I humbly thank you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JUSTICE	Lord Angelo is severe.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Now, what's the matter, Provost?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Is it your will Claudio shall die to-morrow?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Hath he a sister?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	[Going] Save your honour!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's your will?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Well; what's your suit?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Well; the matter?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Must he needs die?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Maiden, no remedy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	I will not do't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	But can you, if you would?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] You are too cold.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Pray you be gone.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[Aside] Ay, well said.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Yet show some pity.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] That's well said.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	[Aside] Pray heaven she win him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] Thou'rt i' th' right, girl; more o' that.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] Art avis'd o' that? More on't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Why do you put these sayings upon me?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Gentle my lord, turn back.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Hark how I'll bribe you; good my lord, turn back.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	How, bribe me?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA) You had marr'd all else.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Well; come to me to-morrow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	[To ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Heaven keep your honour safe!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	At any time 'fore noon.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Save your honour!              Exeunt all but ANGELO
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Hail to you, Provost! so I think you are.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I am the Provost. What's your will, good friar?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	When must he die?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JULIET	I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JULIET	I'll gladly learn.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Love you the man that wrong'd you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JULIET	Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JULIET	Mutually.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	JULIET	I do confess it, and repent it, father.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	SERVANT	One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	I am come to know your pleasure.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Even so! Heaven keep your honour!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Under your sentence?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Yea.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	How say you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	So.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	True.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Then must your brother die.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	We are all frail.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Nay, women are frail too.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Plainly conceive, I love you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	So, then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	[Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Who's there? Come in; the wish deserves a welcome.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	My business is a word or two with Claudio.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Provost, a word with you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	As many as you please.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Now, sister, what's the comfort?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Is there no remedy?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	But is there any?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Perpetual durance?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	But in what nature?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Let me know the point.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	The precise Angelo!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	O heavens! it cannot be.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Thou shalt not do't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Thanks, dear Isabel.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Be ready, Claudio, for your death to-morrow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Which is the least?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	What says my brother?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Death is a fearful thing.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	And shamed life a hateful.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Alas, alas!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Nay, hear me, Isabel.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	What is your will?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and by have some speech with you; the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Son, I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures. She, having the truth of honour in her, hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible; to-morrow you must die; go to your knees and make ready.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	CLAUDIO	Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	What's your will, father?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	That, now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me a while with the maid; my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	In good time.                            Exit PROVOST
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Let me hear you speak farther; I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Show me how, good father.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	The image of it gives me content already; and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	O heavens! what stuff is here?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was put down, and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd gown to keep him warm; and furr'd with fox on lamb-skins too, to signify that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Come your way, sir. Bless you, good father friar.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	And you, good brother father. What offence hath this man made you, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Marry, sir, he hath offended the law; and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir, for we have found upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have sent to the deputy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman, and a friend of mine.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of Caesar? Art thou led in triumph? What, is there none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What say'st thou to this tune, matter, and method? Is't not drown'd i' th' last rain, ha? What say'st thou, trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The trick of it?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Still thus, and thus; still worse!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she still, ha?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be so; ever your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd consequence; it must be so. Art going to prison, Pompey?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Yes, faith, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell; go, say I sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey- or how?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Well, then, imprison him. If imprisonment be the due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right. Bawd is he doubtless, and of antiquity, too; bawd-born. Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, Pompey. You will turn good husband now, Pompey; you will keep the house.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	And you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	You will not bail me then, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? what news?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I know none. Can you tell me of any?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome; but where is he, think you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	He does well in't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him; something too crabbed that way, friar.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	How should he be made, then?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Some report a sea-maid spawn'd him; some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal'd ice; that I know to be true. And he is a motion generative; that's infallible.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang'd a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women; he was not inclin'd that way.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	O, sir, you are deceiv'd.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	'Tis not possible.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Who- not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; that let me inform you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You do him wrong, surely.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	What, I prithee, might be the cause?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth and the lips; but this I can let you understand: the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Wise? Why, no question but he was.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking; the very stream of his life, and the business he hath helmed, must, upon a warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskilfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much dark'ned in your malice.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Sir, I know him, and I love him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Come, sir, I know what I know.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I fear you not.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But, indeed, I can do you little harm: you'll forswear this again.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I'll be hang'd first. Thou art deceiv'd in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Why should he die, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Go, away with her to prison.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MRS	OVERDONE. Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted a merciful man; good my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please your honour.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advis'd him for th' entertainment of death.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Good even, good father.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Bliss and goodness on you!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Of whence are you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	What news abroad i' th' world?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request; and, as it is, as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure; but security enough to make fellowships accurst. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	What pleasure was he given to?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice. Yet had he framed to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many deceiving promises of life; which I, by my good leisure, have discredited to him, and now he is resolv'd to die.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have labour'd for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty; but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him he is indeed Justice.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he chance to fail, he hath sentenc'd himself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a little. May be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	I am always bound to you.                        Exit
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	I do desire the like.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Fear me not.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never cut of a woman's head.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Come, sir, leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper; if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have your full time of imprisonment, and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a notorious bawd.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Do you call, sir?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your execution. If you think it meet, compound with him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if not, use him for the present, and dismiss him. He cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn the scale.                                                  Exit
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Pray, sir, by your good favour- for surely, sir, a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Ay, sir; a mystery.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery; but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Sir, it is a mystery.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Proof?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Are you agreed?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth oftener ask forgiveness.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe to-morrow four o'clock.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	I do desire to learn, sir; and I hope, if you have occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you a good turn.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	None, since the curfew rung.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Not Isabel?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	No.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	They will then, ere't be long.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	What comfort is for Claudio?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	There's some in hope.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	It is a bitter deputy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	None, sir, none.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	And here comes Claudio's pardon.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MESSENGER	My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this further charge, that you swerve not from the smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow; for as I take it, it is almost day.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I shall obey him.                      Exit MESSENGER
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I told you: Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not us'd it before.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Pray you, let's hear.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th' afternoon?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and, indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubted proof.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	It is now apparent?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touch'd?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless, of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality and desperately mortal.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	He wants advice.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not; drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awak'd him, as if to carry him to execution, and show'd him a seeming warrant for it; it hath not moved him at all.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and constancy. If I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Pray, sir, in what?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	In the delaying death.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Alack! How may I do it, having the hour limited, and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	By the vow of mine order, I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. Shave the head and tie the beard; and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'd before his death. You know the course is common. If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Were you sworn to the Duke, or to the deputy?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	To him and to his substitutes.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	But what likelihood is in that?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion, can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke. You know the character, I doubt not; and the signet is not strange to you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I know them both.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	What ho, Barnardine!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	[Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that noise there? What are you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	[ Within ] Away, you rogue, away; I am sleepy.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep afterwards.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Go in to him, and fetch him out.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	POMPEY	Very ready, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	How now, Abhorson, what's the news with you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ABHORSON	Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not fitted for't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	I swear I will not die to-day for any man's persuasion.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	But hear you-
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	BARNARDINE	Not a word; if you have anything to say to me, come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.                  Exit
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I am your free dependant.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	I'll make all speed.                             Exit
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	[ Within ] Peace, ho, be here!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Ho, by your leave!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	Nay, but it is not so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You shall not be admitted to his sight.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	I am directed by you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Good even. Friar, where's the Provost?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Not within, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set me to't. But they say the Duke will be here to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I lov'd thy brother. If the old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.                                         Exit ISABELLA
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Sir, the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do; he's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee; I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were enough.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Did you such a thing?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Yes, marry, did I; but I was fain to forswear it: they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much like to madness; pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and redeliver our authorities there?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I guess not.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his ent'ring that, if any crave redress of injustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I shall, sir; fare you well.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Be rul'd by him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	O, peace! the friar is come.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO, ESCALUS	Happy return be to your royal Grace!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	You make my bonds still greater.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PETER	Now is your time; speak loud, and kneel before him.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	By course of justice!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Nay, it is ten times strange.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	That's he, indeed.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You were not bid to speak.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	I warrant your honour.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Right.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	That's somewhat madly spoken.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Mended again. The matter- proceed.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	This is most likely!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	O that it were as like as it is true!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ISABELLA	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	My lord, most villainously; believe it.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	FIRST let her show her face, and after speak	
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	What, are you married?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	No, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Are you a maid?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	No, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	A widow, then?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Neither, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Why, you are nothing then; neither maid, widow, nor wife.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are neither maid, widow, nor wife.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Well, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Well, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Charges she moe than me?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Not that I know.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	No? You say your husband.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Know you this woman?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Carnally, she says.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Sirrah, no more.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Enough, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	As any in Vienna, on my word.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her. [Exit an ATTENDANT] Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you shall see how I'll handle her.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Not better than he, by her own report.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Say you?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	I will go darkly to work with her.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Come on, mistress; here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Mum.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	'Tis false.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	How! Know you where you are?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ESCALUS	Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison, in the absence of the Duke.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Most notedly, sir.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report; you, indeed, spoke so of him; and much more, much worse.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	I protest I love the Duke as I love myself.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable abuses!
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Stay, sir; stay awhile.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	This may prove worse than hanging.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	ANGELO	I was, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Never crave him; we are definitive.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Gentle my liege-                           [Kneeling]
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	He dies for Claudio's death.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	MARIANA	Merely, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	It was commanded so.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Had you a special warrant for the deed?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	No, my good lord; it was by private message.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	What's he?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	His name is Barnardine.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	DUKE	Which is that Barnardine?
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	PROVOST	This, my lord.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE	LUCIO	Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	Why then you are in love.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Fie, fie!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Good morrow, my good lords.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	I will not fail you.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Is that anything now?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Good sentences, and well pronounc'd.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	They would be better, if well followed.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose'! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott'ry that he hath devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead- whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description, level at my affection.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear'd my lady his mother play'd false with a smith.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Then is there the County Palatine.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'An you will not have me, choose.' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing he falls straight a-cap'ring; he will fence with his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man's picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal'd under for another.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should refuse to accept him.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition, depending on the caskets.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he call'd.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats- well.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Ay, sir, for three months.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	For three months- well.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Antonio shall become bound- well.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Your answer to that.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Antonio is a good man.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he hath, squand'red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Be assur'd you may.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I will be assur'd I may; and, that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	If it please you to dine with us.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	This is Signior Antonio.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Shylock, do you hear?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	And for three months.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	I do never use it.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	And what of him? Did he take interest?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	This were kindness.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PRINCE OF MOROCCO	Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to master Jew's?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to master Jew's?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but, at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Be God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	No master, sir, but a poor man's son; his father, though I say't, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to live.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Your worship's friend, and Launcelot, sir.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do you know me, father?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I pray you tell me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Do you not know me, father?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing; truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son may, but in the end truth will out.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	I cannot think you are my son.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Lord, how art thou chang'd! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have brought him a present. How 'gree you now?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.                      Exit a SERVANT
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	To him, father.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	God bless your worship!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	Here's my son, sir, a poor boy-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	His master and he, saving your worship's reverence, are scarce cater-cousins-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship; and my suit is-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	One speak for both. What would you?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Serve you, sir.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GOBBO	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Where's your master?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LEONARDO	Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Signior Bassanio!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Gratiano!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	I have suit to you.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	You have obtain'd it.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Well, we shall see your bearing.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit; adieu!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	We have not made good preparation.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	An it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Love-news, in faith!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	By your leave, sir.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Whither goest thou?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup to-night with my new master, the Christian.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	And so will I.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Why, Jessica!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	Call you? What is your will?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect your reproach.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	So do I his.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	And they have conspired together; I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning, falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year, in th' afternoon.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	His words were 'Farewell, mistress'; nothing else.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	His hour is almost past.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Lorenzo, and thy love.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Who's there?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Signior Antonio?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	[Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find there.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SERVANT	Where is my lady?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Here; what would my lord?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	Now, what news on the Rialto?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wreck'd on the narrow seas; the Goodwins I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!-
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Come, the full stop.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	I would it might prove the end of his losses.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter's flight.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was flidge; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	She is damn'd for it.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	My own flesh and blood to rebel!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SOLANIO	Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was us'd to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	MAN	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hears'd at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so- and I know not what's spent in the search. Why, thou- loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my breathing; no tears but o' my shedding!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha, ha!- heard in Genoa.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I am very glad of it; I'll plague him, I'll torture him; I am glad of it.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	TUBAL	But Antonio is certainly undone.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Well then, confess and live.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ALL	Ding, dong, bell.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Is this true, Nerissa?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Yes, faith, my lord.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand ducats.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	What, and stake down?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SALERIO	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	What sum owes he the Jew?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	For me, three thousand ducats.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Hear me yet, good Shylock.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	I pray thee hear me speak.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BALTHASAR	Madam, I go with all convenient speed.         Exit
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Shall they see us?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Why, shall we turn to men?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he comes.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I are out; he tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro's belly; the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	That is done too, sir, only 'cover' is the word.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Will you cover, then, sir?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	For the table, sir, it shall be serv'd in; for the meat, sir, it shall be cover'd; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	I will anon; first let us go to dinner.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	What, is Antonio here?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Ready, so please your Grace.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Do all men kill the things they do not love?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Every offence is not a hate at first.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	I did, my lord.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Is your name Shylock?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Shylock is my name.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Ay, so he says.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Do you confess the bond?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	I do.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Then must the Jew be merciful.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Here 'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Shylock, there's thrice thy money off'red thee.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	O noble judge! O excellent young man!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I have them ready.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Is it so nominated in the bond?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	You, merchant, have you anything to say?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Most rightful judge!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Is that the law?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Here is the money.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Give me my principal, and let me go.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	I have it ready for thee; here it is.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	Shall I not have barely my principal?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	SHYLOCK	I am content.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Get thee gone, but do it.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	DUKE OF VENICE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	That will I do.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	STEPHANO	A friend.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Who comes with her?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Who calls?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo! Sola, sola!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Leave holloaing, man. Here!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Sola! Where, where?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Here!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LAUNCELOT	Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	JESSICA	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	It is your music, madam, of the house.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	LORENZO	Dear lady, welcome home.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	No more than I am well acquitted of.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	He will, an if he live to be a man.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	NERISSA	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	PORTIA	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	ANTONIO	I am dumb.
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	BASSANIO	Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Ay, cousin Slender, and Custalorum.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three hundred years.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	All his successors, gone before him, hath done't; and all his ancestors, that come after him, may: they may give the dozen white luces in their coat.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	It is an old coat.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	The dozen white louses do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I may quarter, coz.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	You may, by marrying.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Not a whit.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Yes, py'r lady! If he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures; but that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements and compremises between you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	The Council shall hear it; it is a riot.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in a riot; the Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your vizaments in that.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death's-bed-Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!-give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old. It were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is goot gifts.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Master Page, I am glad to see you; much good do it your good heart! I wish'd your venison better; it was ill kill'd. How doth good Mistress Page?-and I thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Sir, I thank you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	It could not be judg'd, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	A cur, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog. Can there be more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	He hath wrong'd me, Master Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	If it be confessed, it is not redressed; is not that so, Master Page? He hath wrong'd me; indeed he hath; at a word, he hath, believe me; Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wronged.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the King?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Knight, you have beaten my men, kill'd my deer, and broke open my lodge.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	But not kiss'd your keeper's daughter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Tut, a pin! this shall be answer'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	The Council shall know this.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel: you'll be laugh'd at.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Good worts! good cabbage! Slender, I broke your head; what matter have you against me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you; and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern, and made me drunk, and afterwards pick'd my pocket.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	You Banbury cheese!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	How now, Mephostophilus!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	Slice, I say! pauca, pauca; slice! That's my humour.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	We three to hear it and end it between them.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Fery goot. I will make a prief of it in my note-book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Pistol!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	He hears with ears.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	The tevil and his tam! What phrase is this, 'He hears with ear'? Why, it is affectations.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, by these gloves, did he-or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else!-of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Is this true, Pistol?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What say you, Scarlet and John?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is his five senses; fie, what the ignorance is!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashier'd; and so conclusions pass'd the careers.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	How now, Mistress Ford!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met; by your leave, good mistress.              [Kisses her]
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I shall do that that is reason.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Nay, but understand me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	So I do, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says; I pray you pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his country, simple though I stand here.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	But that is not the question. The question is concerning your marriage.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Ay, there's the point, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	But can you affection the oman? Let us command to know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I will do a greater thing than that upon your request, cousin, in any reason.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Here comes fair Mistress Anne. Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	The dinner is on the table; my father desires your worships' company.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	The dinner attends you, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	I may not go in without your worship; they will not sit till you come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as though I did.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	I pray you, sir, walk in.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	I think there are, sir; I heard them talk'd of.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I love the sport well; but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see the bear loose, are you not?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Ay, indeed, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come, come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Nay, pray you lead the way.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Come on, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Not I, sir; pray you keep on.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Truly, I will not go first; truly, la! I will not do you that wrong.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	I pray you, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which is the way; and there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Well, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Mine host of the Garter!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	What says my bully rook? Speak scholarly and wisely.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Discard, bully Hercules; cashier; let them wag; trot, trot.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I sit at ten pounds a week.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Thou'rt an emperor-Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall tap; said I well, bully Hector?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Do so, good mine host.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	I have spoke; let him follow.  [To BARDOLPH]  Let me see thee froth and lime. I am at a word; follow.   Exit HOST
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade; an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a wither'd serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	It is a life that I have desir'd; I will thrive.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot wield?                                         Exit BARDOLPH
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	He was gotten in drink. Is not the humour conceited?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I am glad I am so acquit of this tinder-box: his thefts were too open; his filching was like an unskilful singer-he kept not time.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	'Convey' the wise it call. 'Steal' foh! A fico for the phrase!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Why, then, let kibes ensue.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Young ravens must have food.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Which of you know Ford of this town?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	I ken the wight; he is of substance good.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Two yards, and more.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	The anchor is deep; will that humour pass?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband's purse; he hath a legion of angels.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	The humour rises; it is good; humour me the angels.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good eyes too, examin'd my parts with most judicious oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my portly belly.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	I thank thee for that humour.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	I will run no base humour. Here, take the humour-letter; I will keep the haviour of reputation.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	I have operations in my head which be humours of revenge.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Wilt thou revenge?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	By welkin and her star!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	With wit or steel?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	NYM	My humour shall not cool; I will incense Page to deal with poison; I will possess him with yellowness; for the revolt of mine is dangerous. That is my true humour.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	I'll go watch.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.  [Exit RUGBY]  An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant shall come in house withal; and, I warrant you, no tell-tale nor no breed-bate; his worst fault is that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish that way; but nobody but has his fault; but let that pass. Peter Simple you say your name is?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Ay, for fault of a better.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	And Master Slender's your master?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Does he not wear a great round beard, like a glover's paring-knife?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	No, forsooth; he hath but a little whey face, with a little yellow beard, a Cain-colour'd beard.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth; but he is as tall a man of his hands as any is between this and his head; he hath fought with a warrener.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	How say you? O, I should remember him. Does he not hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Yes, indeed, does he.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	Out, alas! here comes my master.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert-a box, a green-a box. Do intend vat I speak? A green-a box.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth, I'll fetch it you.  [Aside]  I am glad he went not in himself; if he had found the young man, he would have been horn-mad.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Fe, fe, fe fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je m'en vais a la cour-la grande affaire.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Is it this, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere is dat knave, Rugby?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	What, John Rugby? John!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	Here, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Ay me, he'll find the young man there, and be mad!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Good master, be content.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Wherefore shall I be content-a?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	The young man is an honest man.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	What shall de honest man do in my closet? Dere is no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic; hear the truth of it. He came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vell?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth, to desire her to-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Peace, I pray you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my master, in the way of marriage.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my finger in the fire, and need not.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet; if he had been throughly moved, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I'll do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master-I may call him my master, look you, for I keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	[Aside to QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	You jack'nape; give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by gar, it is a shallenge; I will cut his troat in de park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.                             Exit SIMPLE
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks leave to prate. What the good-year!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	[Within]  Who's within there? ho!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	How now, good woman, how dost thou?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by the way; I praise heaven for it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Shall I do any good, think'st thou? Shall I not lose my suit?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Troth, sir, all is in His hands above; but notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Well, thereby hangs a tale; good faith, it is such another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour's talk of that wart; I shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But, indeed, she is given too much to allicholy and musing; but for you-well, go to.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Will I? I' faith, that we will; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence; and of other wooers.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Faith, but you do, in my mind.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Well, I do, then; yet, I say, I could show you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. What's the matter, woman?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Hang the trifle, woman; take the honour. What is it? Dispense with trifles; what is it?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be knighted.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. What? Thou liest. Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very words. What doth he think of us?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. 'Boarding' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him above deck.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. So will I; if he come under my hatches, I'll never to sea again. Let's be reveng'd on him; let's appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn'd his horses to mine host of the Garter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why, look where he comes; and my good man too; he's as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. You are the happier woman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Well, I hope it be not so.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Why, sir, my wife is not young.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Love my wife!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	What name, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	[Aside]  I will be patient; I will find out this.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I will seek out Falstaff.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	If I do find it-well.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I will not believe such a Cataian though the priest o' th' town commended him for a true man.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	How now, Meg!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Whither go you, George? Hark you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home; go.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD.  [Aside to MRS. PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on her; she'll fit it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. You are come to see my daughter Anne?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	How now, Master Ford!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Yes; and you heard what the other told me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Do you think there is truth in them?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it; but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now they be out of service.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Were they his men?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Marry, were they.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bully rook.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Good mine host o' th' Garter, a word with you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	What say'st thou, my bully rook?         [They go aside]
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavaleiro.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress- said I well?-and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, Mynheers?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Have with you, mine host.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.                                   Exeunt all but FORD
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I will not lend thee a penny.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	I will retort the sum in equipage.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Not a penny.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Why, then the world's mine oyster. Which I with sword will open.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PISTOL	Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ROBIN	Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Give your worship good morrow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Good morrow, good wife.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Not so, an't please your worship.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Good maid, then.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I do believe the swearer. What with me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Two thousand, fair woman; and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Your worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I warrant thee nobody hears-mine own people, mine own people.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Are they so? God bless them, and make them his servants!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well; Mistress Ford, what of her?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Marry, she hath receiv'd your letter; for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him! He's a very jealousy man; she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Blessing on your heart for 't!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Why, I will.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Nay, but do so then; and, look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for 'tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath sent your worship a moming's draught of sack.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Brook is his name?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Ay, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Bless you, sir!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.                                        Exit BARDOLPH
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Good Sir John, I sue for yours-not to charge you; for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are; the which hath something embold'ned me to this unseason'd intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me; if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Speak, good Master Brook; I shall be glad to be your servant.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Very well, sir; proceed.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's name is Ford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Have you receiv'd no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Never.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Have you importun'd her to such a purpose?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where erected it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow'd for your many war-like, courtlike, and learned preparations.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	O, sir!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	O good sir!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I say you shall.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me her assistant, or go-between, parted from me; I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave, her husband, will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not; yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the which his wife seems to me well-favour'd. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer; and there's my harvest-home.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Jack Rugby!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	Sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vat is de clock, Jack?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	'Tis past the hour, sir, that Sir Hugh promis'd to meet.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, he has save his soul dat he is no come; he has pray his Pible well dat he is no come; by gar, Jack Rugby, he is dead already, if he be come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	He is wise, sir; he knew your worship would kill him if he came.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, de herring is no dead so as I vill kill him. Take your rapier, Jack; I vill tell you how I vill kill him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	RUGBY	Alas, sir, I cannot fence!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Villainy, take your rapier.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Bless thee, bully doctor!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Save you, Master Doctor Caius!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Now, good Master Doctor!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Give you good morrow, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vat be all you, one, two, tree, four, come for?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, he is de coward Jack priest of de world; he is not show his face.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Thou art a Castalion-King-Urinal. Hector of Greece, my boy!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	I pray you, bear witness that me have stay six or seven, two tree hours for him, and he is no come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a man of peace.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	'Tis true, Master Shallow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS, I come to fetch you home	I am sworn of the peace; you have show'd yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You must go with me, Master Doctor.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Pardon, Guest Justice. A word, Mounseur Mockwater.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Mock-vater! Vat is dat?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Mockwater, in our English tongue, is valour, bully.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	He will clapper-claw thee tightly, bully.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Clapper-de-claw! Vat is dat?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	That is, he will make thee amends.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, me do look he shall clapper-de-claw me; for, by gar, me vill have it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	And I will provoke him to't, or let him wag.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Me tank you for dat.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	[Aside]  Sir Hugh is there, is he?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	[Aside]  We will do it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, me vill kill de priest; for he speak for a jack- an-ape to Anne Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, 'tis good; vell said.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Let us wag, then.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward; every way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town way.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	I most fehemently desire you you will also look that way.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	I will, Sir.                                      Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Yonder he is, coming this way, Sir Hugh.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	[Aside]  Ah, sweet Anne Page!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Save you, good Sir Hugh!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	What, the sword and the word! Do you study them both, Master Parson?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	And youthful still, in your doublet and hose, this raw rheumatic day!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	There is reasons and causes for it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Fery well; what is it?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike having received wrong by some person, is at most odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you saw.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning, so wide of his own respect.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	What is he?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I think you know him: Master Doctor Caius, the renowned French physician.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Got's will and his passion of my heart! I had as lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Why?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	[Aside]  O sweet Anne Page!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Nay, good Master Parson, keep in your weapon.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	So do you, good Master Doctor.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Disarm them, and let them question; let them keep their limbs whole and hack our English.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	[Aside to CAIUS]  Pray you use your patience; in good time.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Diable! Jack Rugby-mine Host de Jarteer-have I not stay for him to kill him? Have I not, at de place I did appoint?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh, soul-curer and body-curer.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Ay, dat is very good! excellent!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Peace, I say. Hear mine host of the Garter. Am I politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I lose my doctor? No; he gives me the potions and the motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir Hugh? No; he gives me the proverbs and the noverbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have deceiv'd you both; I have directed you to wrong places; your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace; follow, follow, follow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Ha, do I perceive dat? Have you make-a de sot of us, ha, ha?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog our prains together to be revenge on this same scall, scurvy, cogging companion, the host of the Garter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ROBIN	I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Be sure of that-two other husbands.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Where had you this pretty weathercock?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of. What do you call your knight's name, sirrah?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ROBIN	Sir John Falstaff.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Sir John Falstaff!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a league between my good man and he! Is your wife at home indeed?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Indeed she is.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW, PAGE, &C	Well met, Master Ford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Trust me, a good knot; I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go with me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I hope I have your good will, father Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you. But my wife, Master Doctor, is for you altogether.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May; he will carry 't, he will carry 't; 'tis in his buttons; he will carry 't.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I beseech you, heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have sport; I will show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Well, fare you well; we shall have the freer wooing at Master Page's.          Exeunt SHALLOW and SLENDER
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.            Exit RUGBY
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first with him. I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. What, John! what, Robert!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Come, come, come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Here, set it down.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. How now, my eyas-musket, what news with you?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ROBIN	Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here, and hath threat'ned to put me into everlasting liberty, if I tell you of it; for he swears he'll turn me away.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Thou 'rt a good boy; this secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to thee, and shall make thee a new doublet and hose. I'll go hide me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.  [Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ROBIN]  Mistress Page, remember you your cue	
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. O sweet Sir John!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful lady.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Let the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond; thou hast the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admittance.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. A plain kerchief, Sir John; my brows become nothing else, nor that well neither.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou art a tyrant to say so; thou wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were, not Nature, thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Believe me, there's no such thing in me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee there's something extra-ordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog, and say thou art this and that, like a many of these lisping hawthorn-buds that come like women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time; I cannot; but I love thee, none but thee; and thou deserv'st it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	She shall not see me; I will ensconce me behind the arras.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're sham'd, y'are overthrown, y'are undone for ever.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. What cause of suspicion?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. What cause of suspicion? Out upon you, how am I mistook in you!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, alas, what's the matter?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. 'Tis not so, I hope.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at me, then let me be your jest; I deserve it. How now, whither bear you this?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SERVANT	To the laundress, forsooth.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Good Master Ford, be contented; you wrong yourself too much.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen, you shall see sport anon; follow me, gentlemen.                             Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.                        Exeunt EVANS, PAGE, and CAIUS
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Is there not a double excellency in this?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. What a taking was he in when your husband ask'd who was in the basket!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff's being here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. I Will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I cannot find him; may be the knave bragg'd of that he could not compass.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE.  [Aside to MRS. FORD]  Heard you that?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Ay, I do so.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Amen.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Ay, ay; I must bear it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	If there be any pody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Be gar, nor I too; there is no bodies.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	'Tis my fault, Master Page; I suffer for it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Any thing.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Pray you go, Master Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	I pray you now, remembrance to-morrow on the lousy knave, mine host.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Alas, how then?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	. May be he tells you true.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Break their talk, Mistress Quickly; my kinsman shall speak for himself.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I'll make a shaft or a bolt on 't; 'slid, 'tis but venturing.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Be not dismay'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, that I will come cut and longtail, under the degree of a squire.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She calls you, coz; I'll leave you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Now, Master Slender-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Now, good Mistress Anne-
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	What is your will?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	My Will! 'Od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	She is no match for you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FENTON	Sir, will you hear me?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Speak to Mistress Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	That's my master, Master Doctor.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, I say!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Here, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Come, let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my belly's as cold as if I had swallow'd snowballs for pills to cool the reins. Call her in.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	By your leave; I cry you mercy. Give your worship good morrow.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Take away these chalices. Go, brew me a pottle of sack finely.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	With eggs, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.  [Exit BARDOLPH]  How now!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her between eight and nine; I must carry her word quickly. She'll make you amends, I warrant you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well, I Will visit her. Tell her so; and bid her think what a man is. Let her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	I will tell her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Do so. Between nine and ten, say'st thou?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Eight and nine, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Well, be gone; I will not miss her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Peace be with you, sir.                          Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Bless you, sir!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Now, Master Brook, you come to know what hath pass'd between me and Ford's wife?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will not lie to you; I was at her house the hour she appointed me.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	And sped you, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Very ill-favouredly, Master Brook.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	How so, sir; did she change her determination?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	No. Master Brook; but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual 'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our, encounter, after we had embrac'd, kiss'd, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provoked and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	What, while you were there?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	While I was there.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	And did he search for you, and could not find you?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page, gives intelligence of Ford's approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's distraction, they convey'd me into a buck-basket.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	A buck-basket!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm'd me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	And how long lay you there?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffer'd all this. My suit, then, is desperate; you'll undertake her no more.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding; I have received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	'Tis past eight already, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Sure he is by this; or will be presently; but truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Blessing of his heart!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book; I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your master; be not afraid.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	William, how many numbers is in nouns?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Two.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say 'Od's nouns.'
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Peace your tattlings. What is 'fair,' William?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Pulcher.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Polecats! There are fairer things than polecats, sure.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	A stone.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	And what is 'a stone,' William?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	A pebble.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	No, it is 'lapis'; I pray you remember in your prain.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Lapis.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus declined: Singulariter, nominativo; hic, haec, hoc.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark: genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Accusativo, hinc.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Leave your prabbles, oman. What is the focative case, William?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	O-vocativo, O.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Remember, William: focative is caret.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	And that's a good root.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Oman, forbear.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Peace.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	What is your genitive case plural, William?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Genitive case?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Ay.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Genitive: horum, harum, horum.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	Vengeance of Jenny's case; fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	For shame, oman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	YOU do ill to teach the child such words. He teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do fast enough of themselves; and to call 'horum'; fie upon you!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases, and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Prithee hold thy peace.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	WILLIAM	Forsooth, I have forgot.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	It is qui, quae, quod; if you forget your qui's, your quae's, and your quod's, you must be preeches. Go your ways and play; go.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement, complement, and ceremony of it. But are you sure of your husband now?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE.  [Within]  What hoa, gossip Ford, what hoa!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. How now, sweetheart, who's at home besides yourself?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, none but mine own people.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Indeed?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. No, certainly.  [Aside to her]  Speak louder.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind; so curses an Eve's daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying 'Peer-out, peer-out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seem'd but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, does he talk of him?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the last time he search'd for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. How near is he, Mistress Page?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Hard by, at street end; he will be here anon.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I am undone: the knight is here.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why, then, you are utterly sham'd, and he's but a dead man. What a woman are you! Away with him, away with him; better shame than murder.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	No, I'll come no more i' th' basket. May I not go out ere he come?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Creep into the kiln-hole.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Where is it?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. He will seek there, on my word. Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his note. There is no hiding you in the house.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I'll go out then.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. How might we disguise him?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Good hearts, devise something; any extremity rather than a mischief.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. My Maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brainford, has a gown above.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he is; and there's her thrumm'd hat, and her muffler too. Run up, Sir John.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Go, go, sweet Sir John. Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Quick, quick; we'll come dress you straight. Put on the gown the while.                         Exit FALSTAFF
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I would my husband would meet him in this shape; he cannot abide the old woman of Brainford; he swears she's a witch, forbade her my house, and hath threat'ned to beat her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel; and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. But is my husband coming?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Ay, in good sadness is he; and talks of the basket too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door with it as they did last time.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Nay, but he'll be here presently; let's go dress him like the witch of Brainford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.   Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders; your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it down, obey him; quickly, dispatch.                                 Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FIRST SERVANT	Come, come, take it up.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SECOND SERVANT	Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinion'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Why, this is lunatics. This is mad as a mad dog.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Heaven be my witness, you do, if you suspect me in any dishonesty.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	This passes!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Are you not asham'd? Let the clothes alone.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I shall find you anon.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	'Tis unreasonable. Will you take up your wife's clothes? Come away.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Empty the basket, I say.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, man, why?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Here's no man.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SHALLOW	By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart; this is jealousies.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Well, he's not here I seek for.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. What, hoa, Mistress Page! Come you and the old woman down; my husband will come into the chamber.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Old woman? what old woman's that?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Why, it is my maid's aunt of Brainford.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does she? We are simple men; we do not know what's brought to pass under the profession of fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells, by th' figure, and such daub'ry as this is, beyond our element. We know nothing. Come down, you witch, you hag you; come down, I say.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Come, Mother Prat; come. give me your hand.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Are you not asham'd? I think you have kill'd the poor woman.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Hang her, witch!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	By yea and no, I think the oman is a witch indeed; I like not when a oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard under his muffler.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you follow; see but the issue of my jealousy; if I cry out thus upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Let's obey his humour a little further. Come, gentlemen.            Exeunt all but MRS. FORD and MRS. PAGE
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Nay, by th' mass, that he did not; he beat him most unpitifully methought.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. I'll have the cudgel hallow'd and hung o'er the altar; it hath done meritorious service.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. What think you? May we, with the warrant of womanhood and the witness of a good conscience, pursue him with any further revenge?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. The spirit of wantonness is sure scar'd out of him; if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Shall we tell our husbands how we have serv'd him?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the figures out of your husband's brains. If they can find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be the ministers.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. I'll warrant they'll have him publicly sham'd; and methinks there would be no period to the jest, should he not be publicly sham'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your horses; the Duke himself will be to-morrow at court, and they are going to meet him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear not of him in the court. Let me speak with the gentlemen; they speak English?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	'Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever did look upon.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Within a quarter of an hour.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	There is no better way than that they spoke of.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	How? To send him word they'll meet him in the Park at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	You say he has been thrown in the rivers; and has been grievously peaten as an old oman; methinks there should be terrors in him, that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punish'd; he shall have no desires.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	So think I too.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	I will teach the children their behaviours; and I will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my taber.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	That will be excellent. I'll go buy them vizards.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures, and fery honest knaveries.               Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and EVANS
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and can; he'll speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee. Knock, I say.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	[Above]  How now, mine host?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with, me; but she's gone.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Ay, marry was it, mussel-shell. What would you with her?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I spake with the old woman about it.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	And what says she, I pray, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF Marry, she says that the very same man that beguil'd Master Slender of his chain cozen'd him of it	
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	I would I could have spoken with the woman herself; I had other things to have spoken with her too, from him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What are they? Let us know.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Ay, come; quick.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	I may not conceal them, sir.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	What sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	May I be bold to say so, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Ay, sir, like who more bold?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SIMPLE	, I thank your worship; I shall make my master glad with these tidings.                              Exit SIMPLE
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a wise woman with thee?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	BARDOLPH	Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Where is mine host?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	What is the matter, sir?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	I cannot tell vat is dat; but it is tell-a me dat you make grand preparation for a Duke de Jamany. By my trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come; I tell you for good will. Adieu.                          Exit
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	From the two parties, forsooth.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	And have not they suffer'd? Yes, I warrant; speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a white spot about her.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What tell'st thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow; and was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, deliver'd me, the knave constable had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' common stocks, for a witch.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy; I will give over all.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will, at the least, keep your counsel.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	HOST	Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	QUICKLY	I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do what I can to get you a pair of horns.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Come, come; we'll couch i' th' Castle ditch till we see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how to know one another. I come to her in white and cry 'mum'; she cries 'budget,' and by that we know one another.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	I know vat I have to do; adieu.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Fare you well, sir.  [Exit CAIUS]  My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter; but 'tis no matter; better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil, Hugh?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. That cannot choose but amaze him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. If he be not amaz'd, he will be mock'd; if he be amaz'd, he will every way be mock'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. We'll betray him finely.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Sir John! Art thou there, my deer, my male deer.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves, hail kissing-comfits, and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.      [Embracing her]
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Alas, what noise?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Heaven forgive our sins!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	What should this be?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. } Away, away.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. } Away, away.                        [They run off]
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PUCK	Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PUCK	A trial, come.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	Oh, oh, oh!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again; but I will always count you my deer.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon ill employment.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	Well said, fairy Hugh.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I liv'd to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. A puff'd man?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	And as poor as Job?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	And as wicked as his wife?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	EVANS	And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings, and swearings, and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Yet be cheerful, knight; thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	Dispatch'd! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on't; would I were hang'd, la, else!
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Of what, son?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	PAGE	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	SLENDER	I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	CAIUS	Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha' married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page; by gar, I am cozened.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why, did you take her in green?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FORD	This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	ANNE	Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	MRS	PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanc'd.
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	FALSTAFF	When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chas'd.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	EGEUS	Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Thanks, good Egeus; what's the news with thee?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	So is Lysander.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Or else misgraffed in respect of years-
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	O spite! too old to be engag'd to young.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends-
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	O that my prayers could such affection move!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	None, but your beauty; would that fault were mine!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Is all our company here?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his wedding-day at night.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	FLUTE	Here, Peter Quince.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	FLUTE	What is Thisby? A wand'ring knight?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	FLUTE	Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Well, proceed.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	STARVELING	Here, Peter Quince.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	Here, Peter Quince.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father; Snug, the joiner, you, the lion's part. And, I hope, here is a play fitted.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNUG	Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	ALL	That would hang us, every mother's son.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac'd man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Why, what you will.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	At the Duke's oak we meet.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	How now, spirit! whither wander you?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	Tarry, rash wanton; am not I thy lord?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	How long within this wood intend you stay?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	I remember.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	And I am sick when I look not on you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	Ay, there it is.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	CHORUS	Philomel with melody, etc.       [TITANIA Sleeps]
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Stay on thy peril; I alone will go.            Exit
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Are we all met?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Peter Quince!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	STARVELING	I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be written in eight and six.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	STARVELING	I fear it, I promise you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: 'Ladies,' or 'Fair ladies, I would wish you' or 'I would request you' or 'I would entreat you not to fear, not to tremble. My life for yours! If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are.' And there, indeed, let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things- that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanack; find out moonshine, find out moonshine.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Yes, it doth shine that night.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window, where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet-
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	'Odious'- odorous!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here!           Exit
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	FLUTE	Must I speak now?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	'Ninus' tomb,' man! Why, you must not speak that yet; that you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues, and all. Pyramus enter: your cue is past; it is 'never tire.'
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNOUT	O Bottom, thou art chang'd! What do I see on thee?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art translated.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	TITANIA	What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	TITANIA	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	COBWEB	And I.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MOTH	And I.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MUSTARDSEED	And I.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	ALL	Where shall we go?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PEASEBLOSSOM	Hail, mortal!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	COBWEB	Hail!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MOTH	Hail!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MUSTARDSEED	Hail!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	I cry your worships mercy, heartily; I beseech your worship's name.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	COBWEB	Cobweb.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PEASEBLOSSOM	Peaseblossom.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MUSTARDSEED	Mustardseed.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	Stand close; this is the same Athenian.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	This is the woman, but not this the man.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	An if I could, what should I get therefore?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	I hod no judgment when to her I swore.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Helen, it is not so.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	What love could press Lysander from my side?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	You speak not as you think; it cannot be.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I understand not what you mean by this.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	O excellent!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	Sweet, do not scorn her so.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	I say I love thee more than he can do.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Quick, come.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	Lysander, whereto tends all this?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Away, you Ethiope!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	Do you not jest?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	Yes, sooth; and so do you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	'Lower' hark, again.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	Why, get you gone! Who is't that hinders you?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	What! with Lysander?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	With Demetrius.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	I am amaz'd, and know not what to say.            Exit
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	I will be with thee straight.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Yea, art thou there?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	Come hither; I am here.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Where's Peaseblossom?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	COBWEB	Ready.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MUSTARDSEED	Ready.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you, leave your curtsy, good mounsieur.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MUSTARDSEED	What's your will?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the barber's, mounsieur; for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	TITANIA	What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have the tongs and the bones.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	TITANIA	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay. Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	OBERON	There lies your love.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	TITANIA	Music, ho, music, such as charmeth sleep!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PUCK	Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool's eyes peep.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	EGEUS	It is, my lord.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Pardon, my lord.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HERMIA	Yea, and my father.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HELENA	And Hippolyta.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	And he did bid us follow to the temple.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	STARVELING	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	FLUTE	If he come not, then the play is marr'd; it goes not forward, doth it?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	SNUG	Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple; and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am not true Athenian. I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	QUINCE	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PHILOSTRATE	Here, mighty Theseus.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	What are they that do play it?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	And we will hear it.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	He says they can do nothing in this kind.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PHILOSTRATE	SO please your Grace, the Prologue is address'd.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	This fellow doth not stand upon points.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder- a sound, but not in government.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	I wonder if the lion be to speak.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Pyramus draws near the wall; silence.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THISBY	My love! thou art my love, I think.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THISBY	And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PYRAMUS	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THISBY	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PYRAMUS	O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THISBY	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	PYRAMUS	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Now is the moon used between the two neighbours.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear without warning.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	This lion is a very fox for his valour.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	True; and a goose for his discretion.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; for the goose carries not the fox. It is well. Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MOONSHINE	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present-
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	He should have worn the horns on his head.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man should be put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' th' moon?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	I am aweary of this moon. Would he would change!
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Proceed, Moon.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	MOON	All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the Man i' th' Moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THISBY	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LION	[Roaring] O-                           [THISBY runs off]
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Well roar'd, Lion.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Well run, Thisby.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.            [The LION tears THISBY'S Mantle, and exit]
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	And then came Pyramus.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	And so the lion vanish'd.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	HIPPOLYTA	Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and her passion ends the play.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	LYSANDER	She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	And thus she moans, videlicet:-
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	THESEUS	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	DEMETRIUS	Ay, and Wall too.
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	BOTTOM	[Starting up] No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I would not follow him then.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Signior, is all your family within?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Are your doors lock'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	Why? Wherefore ask you this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	What, have you lost your wits?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	Not I. What are you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	My name is Roderigo.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Sir, sir, sir-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Patience, good sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	What profane wretch art thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	Thou are a villain.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You are- a senator.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Truly, I think they are.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Yes, sir, I have indeed.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	'Tis better as it is.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What is the matter, think you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Ancient, what makes he here?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I do not understand.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	He's married.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Marry, to- Come, captain, will you go?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Have with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Here comes another troop to seek for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Holla! Stand there!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Signior, it is the Moor.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	And mine, a hundred and forty.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	SAILOR	[Within.] What, ho! What, ho! What, ho!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Now, what's the business?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	How say you by this change?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST SENATOR	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST SENATOR	He's now in Florence.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Write from us to him, post-post-haste dispatch.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Why, what's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	My daughter! O, my daughter!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	ALL	Dead?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	ALL	We are very sorry for't.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	[To Othello.] What in your own part can you say to this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	Nothing, but this is so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Fetch Desdemona hither.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	Say it, Othello.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BRABANTIO	I'll not have it so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Nor I.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	What would you, Desdemona?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Tonight, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DUKE	This night.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	With all my heart.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST SENATOR	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Iago!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What say'st thou, noble heart?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	What will I do, thinkest thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why, go to bed and sleep.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I will incontinently drown myself.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	It is silliness to live when to live is torment, and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	It cannot be.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Thou art sure of me- go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Where shall we meet i' the morning?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	At my lodging.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I'll be with thee betimes.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	What say you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	No more of drowning, do you hear?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I am changed; I'll go sell all my land.             Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	What from the cape can you discern at sea?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	How? Is this true?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	I she well shipp'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	I shall.                                    Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	SECOND GENTLEMAN	'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	What is she?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, but I fear- How lost you company?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Alas, she has no speech.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	You have little cause to say so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	You shall not write my praise.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	No, let me not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Come on, assay- There's one gone to the harbor?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Ay, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Worse and worse.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	How if fair and foolish?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	To do what?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	'Tis truly so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Let's meet him and receive him.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O my fair warrior!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My dear Othello!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	With him? Why, 'tis not possible.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties- all which the Moor is defective in. Now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this granted- as it is a most pregnant and unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none- a slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself- a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after- a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blest condition.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Adieu.                                              Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	She's a most exquisite lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	And, I'll warrant her, full of game.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	She is indeed perfection.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stope of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What, man! 'Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Where are they?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I'll do't, but it dislikes me.                        Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	'Fore God, an excellent song.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why, he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	To the health of our general!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you justice.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Will you hear't again?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God's above all, and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	It's true, good lieutenant.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	For mine own part- no offense to the general, nor any man of quality- I hope to be saved.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	And so do I too, lieutenant.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs. God forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	ALL	Excellent well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.                                                      Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	But is he often thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	'Zounds! You rogue! You rascal!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	What's the matter, lieutenant?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	A knave teach me my duty! But I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Beat me!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Dost thou prate, rogue?                   Strikes Roderigo.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	Nay, good lieutenant; I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	Come, come, you're drunk.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Drunk?                                          They fight.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What is the matter here?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Hold, for your lives!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Ay, past all surgery.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice; even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he's yours.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I know not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Is't possible?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblest, and the ingredient is a devil.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You or any man living may be drunk at some time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general. I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	You advise me well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Good night, honest Iago.                              Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST MUSICIAN	How, sir, how?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST MUSICIAN	Ay, marry, are they, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	O, thereby hangs a tail.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST MUSICIAN	Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you; and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST MUSICIAN	Well, sir, we will not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again; but, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	FIRST MUSICIAN	We have none such, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech. Wilt thou do this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You have not been abed, then?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Madam, here comes my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Madam, I'll take my leave.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Nay, stay and hear me speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Well, do your discretion.                   Exit Cassio.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Ha! I like not that.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What dost thou say?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Nothing, my lord; or if- I know not what.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I do believe 'twas he.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Who is't you mean?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Went he hence now?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	But shall't be shortly?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	The sooner, sweet, for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Shall't be tonight at supper?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	No, not tonight.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Tomorrow dinner then?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Farewell, my Desdemona; I'll come to thee straight.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	My noble lord-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What dost thou say, Iago?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Why of thy thought, Iago?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O, yes, and went between us very oft.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Indeed!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Honest, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Honest? Ay, honest.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	My lord, for aught I know.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What dost thou think?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Think, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	My lord, you know I love you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I think so too.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Certain, men should be what they seem.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why then I think Cassio's an honest man.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What dost thou mean?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O misery!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Dost thou say so?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	And so she did.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I am bound to thee forever.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Not a jot, not a jot.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I will not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	And yet, how nature erring from itself-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	[Going.] My lord, I take my leave.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Fear not my government.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I once more take my leave.                              Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I am to blame.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I have a pain upon my forehead here.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	How now, what do you here alone?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	A thing for me? It is a common thing-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	To have a foolish wife.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What handkerchief?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Hast stol'n it from her?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	A good wench; give it me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	[Snatching it.] Why, what is that to you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ha, ha, false to me?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why, how now, general! No more of that.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	How now, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I am sorry to hear this.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Is't possible, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Is't come to this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	My noble lord-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Nay, stay; thou shouldst be honest.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Would? Nay, I will.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Death and damnation! O!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O monstrous! monstrous!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Nay, this was but his dream.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I'll tear her all to pieces.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	If it be that-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Yet be content.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O, blood, blood, blood!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	I dare not say he lies anywhere.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Why, man?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	He's a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Go to! Where lodges he?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Can anything be made of this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CLOWN	I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions and by them answer.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	I know not, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Is he not jealous?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Look, where he comes.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Well, my good lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What promise, chuck?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Here, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That which I gave you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I have it not about me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Not?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	No, faith, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Is't possible?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Indeed! is't true?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Then would to God that I had never seen't!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ha! wherefore?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Heaven bless us!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Say you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	It is not lost; but what an if it were?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	How?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I say, it is not lost.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Fetch't, let me see it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I pray, talk me of Cassio.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	In sooth, you are to blame.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Away!                                                Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Is not this man jealous?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Is my lord angry?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Lady, amen.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	Save you, friend Cassio!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	Why, whose is it?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	Leave you! wherefore?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	Why, I pray you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Not that I love you not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Will you think so?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Think so, Iago?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	An unauthorized kiss.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What then?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Ay, what of that?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That's not so good now.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Hath he said anything?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What hath he said?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Faith, that he did- I know not what he did.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What? what?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Lie-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	With her?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	With her, on her, what you will.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Rub him about the temples.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Dost thou mock me?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	A horned man's a monster and a beast.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Did he confess it?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Alas, poor caitiff!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Look, how he laughs already!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I never knew a woman love man so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Alas, poor rogue! I think, i'faith, she loves me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Do you hear, Cassio?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Ha, ha, ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	I marry her! What? A customer! I prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	So, so, so, so. They laugh that win.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Prithee, say true.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I am a very villain else.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Have you scored me? Well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	This is the monkey's own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	"Crying, ""O dear Cassio!"" as it were; his gesture imports it."
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Well, I must leave her company.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Before me! look where she comes.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	An you'll come to supper tonight, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for.                        Exit.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	After her, after her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Faith, I must; she'll rail i' the street else.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Will you sup there?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Faith, I intend so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very fain speak with you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Prithee, come; will you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Go to; say no more.                              Exit Cassio.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	[Advancing.] How shall I murther him, Iago?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O Iago!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	And did you see the handkerchief?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Was that mine?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I would have him nine years akilling. A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Nay, you must forget that.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Nay, that's not your way.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Hang her! I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician. O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	She's the worse for all this.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then, of so gentle a condition!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Ay, too gentle.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	O, 'tis foul in her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	With mine officer!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	That's fouler.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Good, good, the justice of it pleases, very good.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You shall hear more by midnight.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Excellent good. [A trumpet within.] What trumpet is that same?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	God save the worthy general!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	With all my heart, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Lives, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Are you sure of that?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	"[Reads.] ""This fail you not to do, as you will-"""
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Fire and brimstone!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Are you wise?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What, is he angry?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	By my troth, I am glad on't.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Indeed!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I am glad to see you mad.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Why, sweet Othello?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Devil!                                        Strikes her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I have not deserved this.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	[Going.] I will not stay to offend you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Mistress!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What would you with her, sir?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Who, I, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	He is much changed.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	What, strike his wife!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	You have seen nothing, then?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What, did they never whisper?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Never, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Nor send you out o' the way?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Never.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Never, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That's strange.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord, what is your will?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Pray, chuck, come hither.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What is your pleasure?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What horrible fancy's this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Why, what art thou?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Your wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Heaven doth truly know it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O Desdemona! Away! away! away!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	By heaven, you do me wrong.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Are not you a strumpet?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What, not a whore?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	No, as I shall be saved.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Is't possible?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, heaven forgive us!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Faith, half asleep.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	With who?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Why, with my lord, madam.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Who is thy lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	He that is yours, sweet lady.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What's the matter, lady?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Am I that name, Iago?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What name, fair lady?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Such as she says my lord did say I was.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why did he so?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	It is my wretched fortune.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Nay, heaven doth know.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Speak within door.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You are a fool; go to.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	If 'twere no other-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What in the contrary?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You charge me most unjustly.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance; but I find none.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Well, go to, very well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well. By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Very well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	You have said now.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy affair.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	It hath not appeared.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	How do you mean, removing of him?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	And that you would have me to do?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure; I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	I will hear further reason for this.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Your honor is most welcome.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	My lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there; look it be done.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Dismiss me?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	I would you had never seen him!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Come, come, you talk.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Shall I go fetch your nightgown?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	A very handsome man.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	He speaks well.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	It's the wind.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	'Tis neither here nor there.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	There be some such, no question.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Why, would not you?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	No, by this heavenly light!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well i' the dark.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' the world; and having the world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I do not think there is any such woman.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	O, villain that I am!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	It is even so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	O, help, ho! Light! A surgeon!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	What, ho! No watch? No passage? Murther! Murther!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	O, help!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Hark!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	O wretched villain!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Who's there? Whose noise is this that cries on murther?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	We do not know.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Did not you hear a cry?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What are you here that cry so grievously?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	O, help me here!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	That's one of them.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	RODERIGO	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	As you shall prove us, praise us.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Signior Lodovico?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	He, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Cassio?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	How is't, brother?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	My leg is cut in two.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	What is the matter, ho? Who is't that cried?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Who is't that cried?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	No.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	What, of Venice?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Even he, sir. Did you know him?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Know him! ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	I am glad to see you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Roderigo!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	None in the world; nor do I know the man.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	BIANCA	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	As I! foh! fie upon thee!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Who's there? Othello?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ay, Desdemona.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Will you come to bed, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Have you pray'd tonight, Desdemona?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Ay, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Alas, my lord, what may you mean by that?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Talk you of killing?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ay, I do.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Then heaven have mercy on me!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Amen, with all my heart!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Hum!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Think on thy sins.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	They are loves I bear to you.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ay, and for that thou diest.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Peace, and be still!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	I will so. What's the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Ay, but not yet to die.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Then Lord have mercy on me!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	I say, amen.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	He hath confess'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	What, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That he hath used thee.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	How? unlawfully?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	He will not say so.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, my fear interprets! What, is he dead?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Alas, he is betray'd, and I undone!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Down, strumpet!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Nay, if you strive-
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	But half an hour!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Being done, there is no pause.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	But while I say one prayer!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	It is too late.     He stifles her.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	[Within.] My lord, my lord! What, ho! my lord, my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	[Within.] What, ho! my lord, my lord!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Who's there?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	[Within.] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	O, my good lord, yonder's foul murthers done!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What, now?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	But now, my lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	No, Cassio is not kill'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	O, falsely, falsely murther'd!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Alas, what cry is that?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That? what?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	DESDEMONA	A guiltless death I die.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	O, who hath done this deed?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Why, how should she be murther'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Alas, who knows?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	You heard her say herself, it was not I.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	She said so; I must needs report the truth.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	She was false as water.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	My husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Thy husband.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	That she was false to wedlock?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	My husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	My husband?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Peace, you were best.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	What is the matter? How now, general?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	What is the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	But did you ever tell him she was false?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I did.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	ALL	O heavens forfend!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	And your reports have set the murther on.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Nay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	'Tis a strange truth.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	MONTANO	O monstrous act!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O! O! O!                                 Falls on the bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	O heaven! O heavenly powers!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	'Zounds! Hold your peace.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Be wise, and get you home.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Villainous whore!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	Filth, thou liest!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	EMILIA	Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.          Exit Iago.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	What is the matter?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	That's he that was Othello. Here I am.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	Wrench his sword from him.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	IAGO	I bleed, sir, but not kill'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Ay.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Dear general, I never gave you cause.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	What, not to pray?
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	Torments will ope your lips.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	Well, thou dost best.
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O villain!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	CASSIO	Most heathenish and most gross!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	OTHELLO	O fool! fool! fool!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	LODOVICO	O bloody period!
THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO, MOOR OF VENICE	GRATIANO	All that's spoke is marr'd.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	I have, my liege.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	To God, the widow's champion and defence.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	MARSHAL	My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	I swear.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	MOWBRAY	And I, to keep all this.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	What is six winters? They are quickly gone.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	What said our cousin when you parted with him?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Where lies he?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	At Ely House.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Should dying men flatter with those that live?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	No, no; men living flatter those that die.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GAUNT	O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	What says he?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Why, uncle, what's the matter?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	WILLOUGHBY	Barely in title, not in revenues.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Richly in both, if justice had her right.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	ROSS	The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	WILLOUGHBY	The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	WILLOUGHBY	Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	ROSS	To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	Now God in heaven forbid!
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	Despair not, madam.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GREEN	Here comes the Duke of York.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVINGMAN	My lord, your son was gone before I came.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	What is't, knave?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVINGMAN	An hour before I came, the Duchess died.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BUSHY	Well, we may meet again.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	PERCY	I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, is he not with the Queen?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	ROSS	Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	WILLOUGHBY	And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BERKELEY	My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle!-
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble Duke hath been too much abused.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	ROSS	It stands your Grace upon to do him right.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	WILLOUGHBY	Base men by his endowments are made great.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SCROOP	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SCROOP	Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Where is the Duke my father with his power?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	My liege, one word.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	What says his Majesty?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Yea, my good lord.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	Madam, we'll play at bowls.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	Madam, we'll dance.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	Madam, we'll tell tales.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	Of sorrow or of joy?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	Of either, madam.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	Madam, I'll sing.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	LADY	I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVANT	What, are they dead?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVANT	What, think you the King shall be deposed?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BAGOT	Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	FITZWATER	Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SURREY	As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	FITZWATER	Surrey, thou liest.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	CARLISLE	As surely as I live, my lord.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	I will be his conduct.                              Exit
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	I thought you had been willing to resign.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Are you contented to resign the crown?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord-
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Name it, fair cousin.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Yet ask.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	And shall I have?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	You shall.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Then give me leave to go.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Whither?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	ABBOT	A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	And must we be divided? Must we part?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	Banish us both, and send the King with me.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	NORTHUMBERLAND	That were some love, but little policy.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	Then whither he goes thither let me go.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	QUEEN	So longest way shall have the longest moans.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	Where did I leave?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	Here comes my son Aumerle.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	For aught I know, my lord, they do.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	You will be there, I know.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	If God prevent not, I purpose so.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	My lord, 'tis nothing.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	What is the matter, my lord?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	Why, York, what is it, my lord?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	What is the matter?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	Peace, foolish woman.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	Thy life answer!
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	Give me my boots, I say.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	Make way, unruly woman!                             Exit
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	And what said the gallant?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Where is the King?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	[Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	AUMERLE	Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	[Within] I What ho, my liege, for God's sake, let me in.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	What shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Rise up, good aunt.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	YORK	Speak it in French, King, say 'pardonne moy.'
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	BOLINGBROKE	I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	DUCHESS	A god on earth thou art.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVANT	These were his very words.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	SERVANT	He did.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GROOM	Hail, royal Prince!
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GROOM	So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KEEPER	Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	GROOM	my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KEEPER	My lord, will't please you to fall to?
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	KING RICHARD	Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.
KING RICHARD THE SECOND	EXTON	From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Upon what cause?
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	Because my name is George.
KING RICHARD III	BRAKENBURY	With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
KING RICHARD III	BRAKENBURY	What one, my lord?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	What news abroad?
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	He is.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST GENTLEMAN	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	By such despair I should accuse myself.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Say that I slew them not?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	I did not kill your husband.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Why, then he is alive.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	I grant ye.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	The better for the King of Heaven, that hath him.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	And thou unfit for any place but hell.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Some dungeon.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Your bed-chamber.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	I hope so.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Name him.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Plantagenet.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Why, that was he.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	The self-same name, but one of better nature.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Where is he?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit at me?
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	I have already.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	I would I knew thy heart.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	I fear me both are false.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Then never was man true.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	well put up your sword.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Say, then, my peace is made.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	That shalt thou know hereafter.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	But shall I live in hope?
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	All men, I hope, live so.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	What is it?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Bid me farewell.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Sirs, take up the corse.
KING RICHARD III	GENTLEMEN	Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	If he were dead, what would betide on me?
KING RICHARD III	GREY	No other harm but loss of such a lord.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The loss of such a lord includes all harms.
KING RICHARD III	RIVER	Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
KING RICHARD III	GREY	Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
KING RICHARD III	DERBY	God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks cheerfully.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
KING RICHARD III	GREY	To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
KING RICHARD III	RIVERS	She may, my lord; for-
KING RICHARD III	RIVERS	What, marry, may she?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	Which God revenge!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my sight?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	So just is God to right the innocent.
KING RICHARD III	RIVERS	Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
KING RICHARD III	DORSET	No man but prophesied revenge for it.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Margaret!
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	Richard!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Ha?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	I call thee not.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thus have you breath'd your curse against yourself.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	Foul shame upon you! you have all mov'd mine.
KING RICHARD III	DORSET	Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
KING RICHARD III	DORSET	It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Have done, have done.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
KING RICHARD III	RIVERS	And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I never did her any to my knowledge.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go with me?
KING RICHARD III	KEEPER	Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
KING RICHARD III	KEEPER	What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
KING RICHARD III	KEEPER	Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Ho! who's here?
KING RICHARD III	BRAKENBURY	What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st thou hither?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
KING RICHARD III	BRAKENBURY	What, so brief?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Why, he shall never wake until the great judgment-day.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him sleeping.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	What, art thou afraid?
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	So I am, to let him live.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Remember our reward, when the deed's done.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Where's thy conscience now?
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	What if it come to thee again?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the sigh.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with me.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the next room.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	O excellent device! and make a sop of him.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Soft! he wakes.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Strike!
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	No, we'll reason with him.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	In God's name, what art thou?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	A man, as you are.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	But not as I am, royal.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Nor you as we are, loyal.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	My voice is now the King's, my looks mine own.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	To, to, to-
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	To murder me?
KING RICHARD III	BOTH MURDERERS	Ay, ay.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Offended us you have not, but the King.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	What we will do, we do upon command.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester hates you.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Ay, so we will.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	What shall we do?
KING RICHARD III	CLARENCE	Relent, and save your souls.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST MURDERER	Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND MURDERER	Look behind you, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
KING RICHARD III	RIVERS	And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
KING RICHARD III	KING EDWARD	Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
KING RICHARD III	KING EDWARD	Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
KING RICHARD III	DERBY	A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
KING RICHARD III	KING EDWARD	I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
KING RICHARD III	DERBY	I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
KING RICHARD III	KING EDWARD	Then say at once what is it thou requests.
KING RICHARD III	SON	Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	No, boy.
KING RICHARD III	DAUGHTER	And so will I.
KING RICHARD III	SON	Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Ay, boy.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	What means this scene of rude impatience?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To make an act of tragic violence.
KING RICHARD III	CHILDREN	Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
KING RICHARD III	CHILDREN	What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Was never widow had so dear a loss.
KING RICHARD III	CHILDREN	Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	And so say I.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so fast?
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	Yes, that the King is dead.
KING RICHARD III	THIRD CITIZEN	Neighbours, God speed!
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	Give you good morrow, sir.
KING RICHARD III	THIRD CITIZEN	Doth the news hold of good King Edward's death?
KING RICHARD III	SECOND CITIZEN	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
KING RICHARD III	THIRD CITIZEN	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall reign.
KING RICHARD III	THIRD CITIZEN	Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.
KING RICHARD III	FIRST CITIZEN	Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be well.
KING RICHARD III	SECOND CITIZEN	Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
KING RICHARD III	ARCHBISHOP	And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
KING RICHARD III	YORK	Grandam, his nurse.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast born.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.
KING RICHARD III	ARCHBISHOP	Good madam, be not angry with the child.
KING RICHARD III	ARCHBISHOP	Here comes a messenger. What news?
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	How doth the Prince?
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	Well, madam, and in health.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	What is thy news?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Who hath committed them?
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
KING RICHARD III	ARCHBISHOP	For what offence?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Stay, I will go with you.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	You have no cause.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your chamber.
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	I go, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Upon record, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never live long.
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	What say you, uncle?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	What, my gracious lord?
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
KING RICHARD III	YORK	Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	He hath, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	And therefore is he idle?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	Then he is more beholding to you than I.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	A beggar, brother?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	How?
KING RICHARD III	YORK	Little.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
KING RICHARD III	YORK	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Why, what should you fear?
KING RICHARD III	PRINCE	I fear no uncles dead.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Nor none that live, I hope.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	You shall, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	[Within]  Who knocks?
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	One from the Lord Stanley.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	[Within]  What is't o'clock?
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	What then?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	Many good morrows to my noble lord!
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the crown?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	Ay, my good lord.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
KING RICHARD III	PURSUIVANT	The better that your lordship please to ask.
KING RICHARD III	PURSUIVANT	God hold it, to your honour's good content!
KING RICHARD III	PRIEST	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
KING RICHARD III	VAUGHAN	You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Is all things ready for the royal time?
KING RICHARD III	DERBY	It is, and wants but nomination.
KING RICHARD III	BISHOP OF ELY	To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
KING RICHARD III	BISHOP OF ELY	Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
KING RICHARD III	BISHOP OF ELY	In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
KING RICHARD III	BISHOP of ELY	Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
KING RICHARD III	HASTINGS	If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
KING RICHARD III	LOVEL	Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Lord Mayor-
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Look to the drawbridge there!
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Hark! a drum.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	Had he done so?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	How now, how now! What say the citizens?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	And did they so?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
KING RICHARD III	MAYOR	God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
KING RICHARD III	ALL	Amen.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
KING RICHARD III	GLOUCESTER	Even when you please, for you will have it so.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The King! Who's that?
KING RICHARD III	BRAKENBURY	I mean the Lord Protector.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	I am their father's mother; I will see them.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
KING RICHARD III	DORSET	Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
KING RICHARD III	DORSET	Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
KING RICHARD III	ANNE	Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	My gracious sovereign?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Still live they, and for ever let them last!
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Say on, my loving lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	True, noble Prince.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Your Grace may do your pleasure.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	[Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he gnaws his lip.
KING RICHARD III	PAGE	My lord?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	What is his name?
KING RICHARD III	PAGE	His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
KING RICHARD III	TYRREL	James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Art thou, indeed?
KING RICHARD III	TYRREL	Prove me, my gracious lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
KING RICHARD III	TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower	
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	I hear the news, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look unto it.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	What says your Highness to my just request?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	My lord-
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, your promise for the earldom-
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	My lord-
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Ay, what's o'clock?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Well, but o'clock?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Upon the stroke of ten.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Well, let it strike.
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Why let it strike?
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	May it please you to resolve me in my suit.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	But didst thou see them dead?
KING RICHARD III	TYRREL	I did, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
KING RICHARD III	TYRREL	I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	My lord!
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so bluntly?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN MARGARET	Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.                                       Exit
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Why should calamity be fun of words?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Who intercepts me in my expedition?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Where is kind Hastings?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Art thou my son?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	Then patiently hear my impatience.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	O, let me speak!
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Do, then; but I'll not hear.
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	I will be mild and gentle in my words.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	And came I not at last to comfort you?
KING RICHARD III	DUCHESS	I prithee hear me speak.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	You speak too bitterly.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	So.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To save her life I'll say she is not so.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Her life is safest only in her birth.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	advancement of your children, gentle lady.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	What do you think?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Even he that makes her Queen. Who else should be?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What, thou?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Even so. How think you of it?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	How canst thou woo her?
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And wilt thou learn of me?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Madam, with all my heart.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Say that I did all this for love of her.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Tell her the King, that may command, entreats.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To wail the title, as her mother doth.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Say I will love her everlastingly.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown-
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	I swear-
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Then, by my self-
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thy self is self-misus'd.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Now, by the world-
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	My father's death-
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Why, then, by God-
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	The time to come.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I forget myself to be myself?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong yourself.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Yet thou didst kill my children.
KING RICHARD III	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	And be a happy mother by the deed.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	Here, my good lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Catesby, fly to the Duke.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	I will my lord, with all convenient haste.
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	I go.                                            Exit
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	Your Highness told me I should post before.
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY, what news with you	STANLEY, what news with you?
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	Richmond is on the seas.
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Well, as you guess?
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
KING RICHARD III	THIRD MESSENGER	My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
KING RICHARD III	CHRISTOPHER	At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales.
KING RICHARD III	STANLEY	What men of name resort to him?
KING RICHARD III	CHRISTOPHER	Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
KING RICHARD III	SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley	SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
KING RICHARD III	BUCKINGHAM	Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
KING RICHARD III	SHERIFF	No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
KING RICHARD III	SHERIFF	It is, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	HERBERT	I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
KING RICHARD III	SURREY	My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	My Lord of Norfolk!
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	Here, most gracious liege.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	We must both give and take, my loving lord.
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	What is't o'clock?
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	I go, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Catesby!
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	My lord?
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	My lord?
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	It is, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Bid my guard watch; leave me.
KING RICHARD III	DERBY	Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
KING RICHARD III	GHOST OF GREY	[To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	My lord!
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Zounds, who is there?
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	No doubt, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
KING RICHARD III	LORDS	Good morrow, Richmond!
KING RICHARD III	LORDS	How have you slept, my lord?
KING RICHARD III	LORDS	Upon the stroke of four.
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	That he was never trained up in arms.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	He said the truth; and what said Surrey then?
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	Not I, my lord.
KING RICHARD III	RATCLIFF	My lord?
KING RICHARD III	NORFOLK	Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
KING RICHARD III	MESSENGER	My lord, he doth deny to come.
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	Off with his son George's head!
KING RICHARD III	KING RICHARD	A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
KING RICHARD III	CATESBY	Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
KING RICHARD III	RICHMOND	What men of name are slain on either side?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Master, some show to welcome us to town.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	And me, too, good Lord!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to labour and effect one thing specially.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	What's that, I pray?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	A husband? a devil.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	I say a husband.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	I have it, Tranio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Tell me thine first.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	It is. May it be done?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I, sir? Ne'er a whit.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	The better for him; would I were so too!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	FIRST SERVANT	My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	SLY	Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes there any more of it?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PAGE	My lord, 'tis but begun.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once, he'll rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by awhile.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	O this learning, what a thing it is!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Peace, sirrah!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	And that his bags shall prove.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Will I live?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	For he fears none.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	And so we will- provided that he win her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Even he, Biondello.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	[Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	No; if without more words you will get you hence.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	But so is not she.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	For what reason, I beseech you?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO, BIONDELLO	O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, what's a moveable?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	A join'd-stool.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Women are made to bear, and so are you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	No such jade as you, if me you mean.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Should be! should- buzz!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	My remedy is then to pluck it out.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	In his tongue.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Whose tongue?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	What is your crest- a coxcomb?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	There is, there is.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Then show it me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Had I a glass I would.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	What, you mean my face?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Well aim'd of such a young one.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Yet you are wither'd.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	'Tis with cares.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I care not.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Where did you study all this goodly speech?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	It is extempore, from my mother wit.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	A witty mother! witless else her son.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Am I not wise?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Yes, keep you warm.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO, TRANIO	Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	And may not young men die as well as old?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	That will be never- tune your instrument.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Where left we last?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Construe them.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Madam, my instrument's in tune.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Madam, 'tis now in tune.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	All but the bass.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Is it new and old too? How may that be?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Is he come?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Why, no, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	What then?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	He is coming.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	When will he be here?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	When he stands where I am and sees you there.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	But, say, what to thine old news?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with an old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess'd with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway'd in the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec'd, and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with pack-thread.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Who comes with him?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Why, sir, he comes not.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Didst thou not say he comes?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Who? that Petruchio came?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Ay, that Petruchio came.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Why, that's all one.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	You are welcome, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	And yet I come not well.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	And yet you halt not.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	As willingly as e'er I came from school.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	What said the wench, when he rose again?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Is't possible you will away to-night?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	It may not be.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Let me entreat you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	It cannot be.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Let me entreat you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I am content.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Are you content to stay?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Now, if you love me, stay.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Grumio, my horse.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Of all mad matches, never was the like.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Who is that calls so coldly?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no water.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand- thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n out.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	How?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a tale.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Let's ha't, good Grumio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Lend thine ear.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Here.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	There.                                  [Striking him]
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Both of one horse?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	What's that to thee?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Why, a horse.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never pray'd before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc'd to thy grave.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	They are.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Call them forth.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my mistress.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Why, she hath a face of her own.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	Who knows not that?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	CURTIS	I call them forth to credit her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	NATHANIEL	Welcome home, Grumio!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PHILIP	How now, Grumio!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	JOSEPH	What, Grumio!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	NICHOLAS	Fellow Grumio!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	NATHANIEL	How now, old lad!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!- and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	NATHANIEL	All things is ready. How near is our master?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	ALL SERVANTS	Here, here, sir; here, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	FIRST SERVANT	Ay.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Who brought it?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETER	I.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	NATHANIEL	Peter, didst ever see the like?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Where is he?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Mistress, we have.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Then we are rid of Licio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	God give him joy!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Ay, and he'll tame her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	He says so, Tranio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	What is he, Biondello?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	And what of him, Tranio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	God save you, sir!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	What countryman, I pray?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Of Mantua.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Among them know you one Vincentio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	What say you to a neat's foot?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	A dish that I do love to feed upon.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Why then the mustard without the beef.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Mistress, what cheer?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Faith, as cold as can be.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I pray you, let it stand.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I thank you, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HABERDASHER	Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	But how did you desire it should be made?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	But did you not request to have it cut?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Thou hast fac'd many things.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	I have.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Read it.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread; I said a gown.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Proceed.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	[Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	I confess the cape.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	I confess two sleeves.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Ay, there's the villainy.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TAILOR	This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou shouldst know it.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy meteyard, and spare not me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GRUMIO	Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Tut, fear not me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Cambio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	What say'st thou, Biondello?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Biondello, what of that?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	I pray thee moralize them.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	And what of him?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	And then?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	And what of all this?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Hear'st thou, Biondello?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Say as he says, or we shall never go.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	I know it is the moon.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	What is his name?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Lucentio, gentle sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	I do assure thee, father, so it is.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at home, therefore leave us.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so long as I live.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the window.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Art thou his father?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio! Now we are undone and brought to nothing.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	[Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I hope I may choose, sir.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy master's father, Vincentio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see where he looks out of the window.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	How now! what's the matter?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	What, is the man lunatic?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you think is his name?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Carry me to the gaol!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd in this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PEDANT	Swear if thou dar'st.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Nay, I dare not swear it.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	TRANIO	Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Lives my sweet son?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Pardon, dear father.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to the gaol.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	[To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	What, in the midst of the street?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	What, art thou asham'd of me?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	For both our sakes I would that word were true.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	Then never trust me if I be afeard.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Roundly replied.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	Mistress, how mean you that?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	Thus I conceive by him.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	A very mean meaning.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	Right, I mean you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	To her, Kate!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	To her, widow!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	That's my office.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	GREMIO	Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	A good swift simile, but something currish.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Content. What's the wager?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Twenty crowns.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	A hundred then.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Content.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	A match! 'tis done.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Who shall begin?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIONDELLO	I go.                                          Exit
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I hope better.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	I know her answer.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	What?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	She will not.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BAPTISTA	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	What is your sir, that you send for me?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	KATHERINA	They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	BIANCA	The more fool you for laying on my duty.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	WIDOW	She shall not.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	I say she shall. And first begin with her.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	PETRUCHIO	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	VINCENTIO	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	LUCENTIO	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	HORTENSIO	Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.
THE TEMPEST	MASTER	Boatswain!
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	Here, master; what cheer?
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	I pray now, keep below.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Where is the master, boson?
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	Do you not hear him? You mar our labour; keep your cabins; you do assist the storm.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Nay, good, be patient.
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin! silence! Trouble us not.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	None that I more love than myself. You are counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority; if you cannot, give thanks you have liv'd so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.-Cheerly, good hearts!-Out of our way, I say.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	Work you, then.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker; we are less afraid to be drown'd than thou art.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
THE TEMPEST	BOATSWAIN	What, must our mouths be cold?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	I am out of patience.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Let's all sink wi' th' King.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	O, woe the day!
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Certainly, sir, I can.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	But that I do not.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Sir, are not you my father?
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Sir, most heedfully.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	O, good sir, I do!
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	O the heavens!
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	How came we ashore?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Close by, my master.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	But are they, Ariel, safe?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Past the mid season.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	My liberty.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Before the time be out? No more!
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	No.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	I do not, sir.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	No, sir.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Sir, in Argier.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Ay, sir.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Yes, Caliban her son.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	I thank thee, master.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	[ Within]  There's wood enough within.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	My lord, it shall be done.                         Exit
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Alack, for mercy!
THE TEMPEST	FERDINAND	No, as I am a man.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Beseech you, father!
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Hence! Hang not on my garments.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	To th' syllable.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Prithee, peace.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	He receives comfort like cold porridge.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	The visitor will not give him o'er so.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Sir-
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	One-Tell.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	A dollar.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken truer than you purpos'd.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Therefore, my lord-
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	I prithee, spare.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Well, I have done; but yet-
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	He will be talking.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	The old cock.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	The cock'rel.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Done. The wager?
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	A laughter.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	A match!
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	Though this island seem to be desert-
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Ha, ha, ha!
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	So, you're paid.
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Yet-
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	Yet-
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	He could not miss't.
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Temperance was a delicate wench.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly deliver'd.
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Here is everything advantageous to life.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	True; save means to live.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Of that there's none, or little.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	The ground indeed is tawny.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	With an eye of green in't.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	He misses not much.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit-
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	As many vouch'd rarities are.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dy'd, than stain'd with salt water.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon to their queen.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Not since widow Dido's time.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow' in? Widow Dido!
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
THE TEMPEST	ADRIAN	Carthage?
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	I assure you, Carthage.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	His word is more than the miraculous harp.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	What impossible matter will he make easy next?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Ay.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Why, in good time.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now Queen.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	And the rarest that e'er came there.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	That 'sort' was well fish'd for.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	No, no, he's gone.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Prithee, peace.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	So is the dear'st o' th' loss.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Very well.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	And most chirurgeonly.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Foul weather?
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Very foul.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Or docks, or mallows.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	And were the king on't, what would I do?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Scape being drunk for want of wine.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Yet he would be king on't.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	No marrying 'mong his subjects?
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Save his Majesty!
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Long live Gonzalo!
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	And-do you mark me, sir?
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	I do well believe your Highness; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	'Twas you we laugh'd at.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you; so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	What a blow was there given!
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	An it had not fall'n flat-long.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	It is the quality o' th' climate.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	What, art thou waking?
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Do you not hear me speak?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Well, I am standing water.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	I'll teach you how to flow.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	He's gone.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Claribel.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Methinks I do.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	But, for your conscience-
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	Then let us both be sudden.
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	What's the matter?
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	I heard nothing.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Heard you this, Gonzalo?
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Lead away.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Do not torment me. O!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind? Ha! I have not scap'd drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said: As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at nostrils.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	The spirit torments me. O!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat. Open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly; you cannot tell who's your friend. Open your chaps again.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	I should know that voice; it should be-but he is drown'd; and these are devils. O, defend me!
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Stephano!
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo-be not afeard-thy good friend Trinculo.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	[Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	O Stephano, hast any more of this?
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man i' th' Moon, when time was.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee. My mistress show'd me thee, and thy dog and thy bush.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island; and will kiss thy foot. I prithee be my god.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster! When's god's asleep he'll rob his bottle.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Come on, then; down, and swear.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy- headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him-
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Come, kiss.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	But that the poor monster's in drink. An abominable monster!
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	[Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	A howling monster; a drunken monster!
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	You look wearily.
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Do you love me?
THE TEMPEST	FERDINAND	Wherefore weep you?
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	My husband, then?
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Servant-monster! The folly of this island! They say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th' other two be brain'd like us, the state totters.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee; thy eyes are almost set in thy head.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh'd fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half fish and half a monster?
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord?
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head; if you prove a mutineer-the next tree! The poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas'd to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Thou liest.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Why, I said nothing.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	That's most certain.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	How now shall this be compass'd? Canst thou bring me to the party?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Thou liest; thou canst not.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt the monster one word further and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther off.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Didst thou not say he lied?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Thou liest.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Do I so? Take thou that.  [Beats him]  As you like this, give me the lie another time.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! This can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Ha, ha, ha!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Now, forward with your tale.-Prithee stand further off.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat him too.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Stand farther. Come, proceed.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Is it so brave a lass?
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Excellent.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Give me thy hand; I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy head.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Ay, on mine honour.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	This will I tell my master.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	What is this same?
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the picture of Nobody.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness; if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	O, forgive me my sins!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Art thou afeard?
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	No, monster, not I.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	When Prospero is destroy'd.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	That shall be by and by; I remember the story.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	The sound is going away; let's follow it, and after do our work.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see this taborer; he lays it on.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
THE TEMPEST	GONZALO	Marvellous sweet music!
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	[Aside]  Praise in departing.
THE TEMPEST	FRANCISCO	They vanish'd strangely.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Not I.
THE TEMPEST	ANTONIO	I'll be thy second.      Exeunt SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	What would my potent master? Here I am.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Presently?
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Ay, with a twink.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Well! I conceive.                                  Exit
THE TEMPEST	FERDINAND, MIRANDA	We wish your peace.                 Exeunt
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	I go, I go.                                        Exit
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than play'd the Jack with us.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Monster, I do smell all horse-piss at which my nose is in great indignation.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you-
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Thou wert but a lost monster.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have that gown.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Thy Grace shall have it.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line; now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Do, do. We steal by line and level, an't like your Grace.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent pass of pate; there's another garmet for't.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	And this.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Hey, Mountain, hey!
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Silver! there it goes, Silver!
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Hark, they roar.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Dost thou think so, spirit?
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	Mine would, sir, were I human.
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	I'll fetch them, sir.                              Exit
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	I am woe for't, sir.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	You the like loss!
THE TEMPEST	MIRANDA	Sweet lord, you play me false.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	A most high miracle!
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	'Tis new to thee.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
THE TEMPEST	ARIEL	[Aside to PROSPERO]  Was't well done?
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO, in their stolen appare	TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly sight.
THE TEMPEST	CALIBAN	I shall be pinch'd to death.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	He is drunk now; where had he wine?
THE TEMPEST	TRINCULO	I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.
THE TEMPEST	SEBASTIAN	Why, how now, Stephano!
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?
THE TEMPEST	STEPHANO	I should have been a sore one, then.
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	[Pointing to CALIBAN]  This is as strange a thing as e'er I look'd on.
THE TEMPEST	PROSPERO	Go to; away!
THE TEMPEST	ALONSO	Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Good day, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	I am glad y'are well.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	I have not seen you long; how goes the world?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	It wears, sir, as it grows.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	O, 'tis a worthy lord!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	Nay, that's most fix'd.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	I have a jewel here-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	O, pray let's see't. For the Lord Timon, sir?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	If he will touch the estimate. But for that-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	[Looking at the jewel] 'Tis a good form.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	And rich. Here is a water, look ye.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	'Tis a good piece.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	So 'tis; this comes off well and excellent.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Indifferent.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	How this lord is followed!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	The senators of Athens- happy man!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Look, moe!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	How shall I understand you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	I saw them speak together.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Ay, marry, what of these?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Imprison'd is he, say you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MESSENGER	Your lordship ever binds him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	OLD ATHENIAN	Lord Timon, hear me speak.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Freely, good father.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	OLD ATHENIAN	Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I have so; what of him?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	OLD ATHENIAN	Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCILIUS	Here, at your lordship's service.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Well; what further?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	The man is honest.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Does she love him?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Love you the maid?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCILIUS	Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	OLD ATHENIAN	Three talents on the present; in future, all.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	[Presenting his poem] Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	The gods preserve ye!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	What, my lord! Dispraise?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Look who comes here; will you be chid?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	We'll bear, with your lordship.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	He'll spare none.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know'st them not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Are they not Athenians?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Yes.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Then I repent not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	JEWELLER	You know me, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thou know'st I do; I call'd thee by thy name.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Thou art proud, Apemantus.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Whither art going?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	That's a deed thou't die for.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Right, if doing nothing be death by th' law.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	How lik'st thou this picture, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	The best, for the innocence.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Wrought he not well that painted it?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	He wrought better that made the painter; and yet he's but a filthy piece of work.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Y'are a dog.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thy mother's of my generation; what's she, if I be a dog?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	No; I eat not lords.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	An thou shouldst, thou'dst anger ladies.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	That's a lascivious apprehension.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Not so well as plain dealing, which will not cost a man a doit.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What dost thou think 'tis worth?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	How now, philosopher!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thou liest.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Art not one?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Yes.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Then I lie not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Art not a poet?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Yes.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast feign'd him a worthy fellow.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	That's not feign'd- he is so.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	E'en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What, thyself?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ay.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Wherefore?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	That I had no angry wit to be a lord.- Art not thou a merchant?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	Ay, Apemantus.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	MERCHANT	If traffic do it, the gods do it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What trumpet's that?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Time to be honest.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	That time serves still.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	The more accursed thou that still omit'st it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ay; to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Fare thee well, fare thee well.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Why, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Hang thyself.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests to thy friend.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' th' ass.  Exit
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Long may he live in fortunes! shall we in?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VENTIDIUS	A noble spirit!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	My lord, we always have confess'd it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ho, ho, confess'd it! Hang'd it, have you not?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I take no heed of thee. Th'art an Athenian, therefore welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make thee silent.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	My lord, in heart! and let the health go round.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Let it flow this way, my good lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of friends.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	So they were bleeding new, my lord, there's no meat like 'em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill 'em, and bid me to 'em.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves for ever perfect.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thou weep'st to make them drink, Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	I promise you, my lord, you mov'd me much.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Much!                                [Sound tucket]
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Ladies! What are their wills?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears that office to signify their pleasures.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LADY	My lord, you take us even at the best.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold taking, I doubt me.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Flavius!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	My lord?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	The little casket bring me hither.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Where be our men?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	Here, my lord, in readiness.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	I am so far already in your gifts-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	My lord, there are certain nobles of the Senate newly alighted and come to visit you.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	They are fairly welcome.                   Exit SERVANT
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	I beseech your honour, vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Near! Why then, another time I'll hear thee. I prithee let's be provided to show them entertainment.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND SERVANT	May it please vour honour, Lord Lucius, out of his free love, hath presented to you four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	With more than common thanks I will receive it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	O, he's the very soul of bounty!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	And now I remember, my lord, you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on. 'Tis yours because you lik'd it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	O, I beseech you pardon me, my lord, in that.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL LORDS	O, none so welcome!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Ay, defil'd land, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	We are so virtuously bound-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	And so am I to you.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	So infinitely endear'd-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	All to you. Lights, more lights!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	The best of happiness, honour, and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	No, I'll nothing; for if I should be brib'd too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou giv'st so long, Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps, and vain-glories?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come with better music.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	I go, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	I will, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Good even, Varro. What, you come for money?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	Is't not your business too?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	It is. And yours too, Isidore?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ISIDORE'S SERVANT	It is so.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Would we were all discharg'd!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	I fear it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Dues! Whence are you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Of Athens here, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Go to my steward.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Nay, good my lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Contain thyself, good friend.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	One Varro's servant, my good lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ISIDORE'S SERVANT	From Isidore: he humbly prays your speedy payment-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	If you did know, my lord, my master's wants-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and past.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	Hang him, he'll abuse us!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ISIDORE'S SERVANT	A plague upon him, dog!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	How dost, fool?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	I speak not to thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	No, 'tis to thyself. [To the FOOL] Come away.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ISIDORE'S SERVANT	[To VARRO'S SERVANT] There's the fool hangs on your back already.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	No, thou stand'st single; th'art not on him yet.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	CAPHIS	Where's the fool now?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	He last ask'd the question. Poor rogues and usurers' men! Bawds between gold and want!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL SERVANTS	What are we, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Asses.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL SERVANTS	Why?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	How do you, gentlemen?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL SERVANTS	Gramercies, good fool. How does your mistress?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAGE	[To the FOOL] Why, how now, Captain? What do you in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee profitably!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAGE	Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these letters; I know not which is which.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Canst not read?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAGE	No.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	There will little learning die, then, that day thou art hang'd. This is to Lord Timon; this to Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't die a bawd.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	Will you leave me there?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL SERVANTS	Ay; would they serv'd us!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	So would I- as good a trick as ever hangman serv'd thief.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	Are you three usurers' men?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALL SERVANTS	Ay, fool.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant. My mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly and go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house merrily and go away sadly. The reason of this?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	I could render one.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave; which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	What is a whoremaster, fool?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOOL	A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a spirit. Sometime 't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than's artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	VARRO'S SERVANT	Thou art not altogether a fool.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	That answer might have become Apemantus.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Come with me, fool, come.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Let all my land be sold.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	You tell me true.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Prithee no more.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	Assurance bless your thoughts!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANTS	My lord! my lord!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	As you have said, my lord.          Exeunt SERVANTS
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	[Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Is't true? Can't be?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	Here's my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	His health is well, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCULLUS	I am right glad that his health is well, sir. And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which in my lord's behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply;  who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVANT	Please your lordship, here is the wine.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCULLUS	Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCULLUS	Ha! Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an honourable gentleman.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST STRANGER	We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	Fie, no: do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	How?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND STRANGER	I tell you, denied, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	See, by good hap, yonder's my lord; I have sweat to see his honour.- My honour'd lord!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well; commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord: he's ever sending. How shall I thank him, think'st thou? And what has he sent now?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord, requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS	What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! How unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do- the more beast, I say! I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	Yes, sir, I shall.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST STRANGER	Do you observe this, Hostilius?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND STRANGER	Ay, too well.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD STRANGER	Religion groans at it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT	Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	The like to you, kind Varro.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	HORTENSIUS	Lucius! What, do we meet together?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Ay, and I think one business does command us all; for mine is money.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	And Sir Philotus too!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	Good day at once.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	welcome, good brother, what do you think the hour?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	Labouring for nine.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	So much?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	Is not my lord seen yet?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Not yet.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	I am of your fear for that.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	HORTENSIUS	Most true, he does.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	HORTENSIUS	It is against my heart.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT	Yes, mine's three thousand crowns; what's yours?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Five thousand mine.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	One of Lord Timon's men.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Flaminius! Sir, a word. Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	No, indeed, he is not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	Do you hear, sir?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT	By your leave, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	What do ye ask of me, my friend?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	We wait for certain money here, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT	How! What does his cashier'd worship mutter?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from't; for take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him; he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SERVILIUS	Good gods!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	We cannot take this for answer, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Put in now, Titus.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	My lord, here is my bill.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Here's mine.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	HORTENSIUS	And mine, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH VARRO'S SERVANTS	And ours, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHILOTUS	All our bills.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Knock me down with 'em; cleave me to the girdle.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Alas, my lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Cut my heart in sums.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TITUS	Mine, fifty talents.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Tell out my blood.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	LUCIUS' SERVANT	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Five thousand drops pays that. What yours? and yours?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST VARRO'S SERVANT	My lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND VARRO'S SERVANT	My lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!      Exit
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	My dear lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What if it should be so?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAMINIUS	My lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I'll have it so. My steward!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	Here, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND SENATOR	Most true; the law shall bruise him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Honour, health, and compassion, to the Senate!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	Now, Captain?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	My lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND SENATOR	You breathe in vain.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	What's that?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	He dies.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND SENATOR	How!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Call me to your remembrances.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD SENATOR	What!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	The good time of day to you, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjur'd me beyond them, and I must needs appear.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all things go.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	A thousand pieces.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	A thousand pieces!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	What of you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	With all my heart, gentlemen both! And how fare you?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	[Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such summer-birds are men- Gentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long stay; feast your ears with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' th' trumpet's sound; we shall to't presently.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	O sir, let it not trouble you.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	My noble lord-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame that, when your lordship this other day sent to me, I was so unfortunate a beggar.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Think not on't, sir.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	If you had sent but two hours before-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Let it not cumber your better remembrance. [The banquet brought in] Come, bring in all together.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	All cover'd dishes!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Royal cheer, I warrant you.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	How do you? What's the news?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	Alcibiades is banish'd. Hear you of it?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST AND SECOND LORDS	Alcibiades banish'd!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	'Tis so, be sure of it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	How? how?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	I pray you, upon what?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	My worthy friends, will you draw near?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	This is the old man still.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	Will't hold? Will't hold?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	It does; but time will- and so-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	I do conceive.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SOME SPEAK	What does his lordship mean?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SOME OTHER	I know not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	How now, my lords!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	Push! Did you see my cap?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOURTH LORD	I have lost my gown.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	Did you see my cap?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Here 'tis.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FOURTH LORD	Here lies my gown.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST LORD	Let's make no stay.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND LORD	Lord Timon's mad.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD LORD	I feel't upon my bones.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	What art thou there? Speak.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PHRYNIA	Thy lips rot off!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	How came the noble Timon to this change?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	What is it, Timon?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art man! If thou dost perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	I see them now; then was a blessed time.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Art thou Timandra?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMANDRA	Yes.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMANDRA	Hang thee, monster!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Keep it: I cannot eat it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	When I have laid proud Athens on a heap-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	War'st thou 'gainst Athens?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Ay, Timon, and have cause.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Why me, Timon?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	I never did thee harm.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Yes, thou spok'st well of me.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	ALCIBIADES	Call'st thou that harm?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Were I like thee, I'd throw away myself.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	A fool of thee. Depart.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	I love thee better now than e'er I did.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I hate thee worse.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Why?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Thou flatter'st misery.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Why dost thou seek me out?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	To vex thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ay.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	What, a knave too?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Art thou proud yet?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Ay, that I am not thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	First mend my company: take away thyself.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	So I shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	What wouldst thou have to Athens?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Here is no use for gold.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Where liest a nights, Timon?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Where my stomach. finds meat; or rather, where I eat it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Would poison were obedient, and knew my mind!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Where wouldst thou send it?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	To sauce thy dishes.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mock'd thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary. There's a medlar for thee; eat it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	On what I hate I feed not.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Dost hate a medlar?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Ay, though it look like thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	An th' hadst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Who, without those means thou talk'st of, didst thou ever know belov'd?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Myself.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	I understand thee: thou hadst some means to keep a dog.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ay, Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it, and give way. When I know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	I would my tongue could rot them off!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Would thou wouldst burst!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Beast!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Slave!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Toad!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Throng'd to?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Ay.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Thy back, I prithee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	APEMANTUS	Live, and love thy misery!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST BANDIT	Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this melancholy.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND BANDIT	It is nois'd he hath a mass of treasure.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD BANDIT	Let us make the assay upon him; if he care not for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall's get it?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND BANDIT	True; for he bears it not about him. 'Tis hid.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST BANDIT	Is not this he?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BANDITTI	Where?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND BANDIT	'Tis his description.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD BANDIT	He; I know him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BANDITTI	Save thee, Timon!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Now, thieves?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BANDITTI	Soldiers, not thieves.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Both too, and women's sons.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BANDITTI	We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	THIRD BANDIT	Has almost charm'd me from my profession by persuading me to it.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST BANDIT	'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND BANDIT	I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Away! What art thou?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	Have you forgot me, sir?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	An honest poor servant of yours.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where he abides.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	to be thought of him? Does the rumour hold for true that he's so full of gold?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Certain. Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him. He likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with great quantity. 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Nothing else. You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his; it will show honestly in us, and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for, if it be just and true report that goes of his having.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	What have you now to present unto him?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Nothing at this time but my visitation; only I will promise him an excellent piece.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent that's coming toward him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	[Aside] Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him. It must be a personating of himself; a satire against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	[Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Hail, worthy Timon!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	Our late noble master!
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Have I once liv'd to see two honest men?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Ay, you are honest men.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	We are hither come to offer you our service.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	So, so, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	You'll take it ill.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	Most thankfully, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Will you indeed?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	Doubt it not, worthy lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	Do we, my lord?
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	PAINTER	I know not such, my lord.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	POET	Nor I.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	Name them, my lord; let's know them.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	Worthy Timon-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	Therefore, Timon-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	Stay not, all's in vain.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	We speak in vain.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	That's well spoke.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	TIMON	Commend me to my loving countrymen-
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	These words become your lips as they pass through them.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	I like this well; he will return again.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FLAVIUS	Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	SECOND SENATOR	We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	FIRST SENATOR	Here come our brothers.
THE LIFE OF TIMON OF ATHENS	BOTH	'Tis most nobly spoken.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	O cruel, irreligious piety!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Patience, Prince Saturninus.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	How, sir! Are you in earnest then, my lord?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Surpris'd! By whom?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MUTIUS	My lord, you pass not here.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	These words are razors to my wounded heart.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	QUINTUS & MARTIUS	And shall, or him we will accompany.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	QUINTUS	He that would vouch it in any place but here.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	What, would you bury him in my despite?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARTIUS	He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	QUINTUS	Father, and in that name doth nature speak-
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Renowned Titus, more than half my soul-
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Dear father, soul and substance of us all-
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Rise, Titus, rise; my Empress hath prevail'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	That on mine honour here do I protest.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?              [They draw]
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	To achieve her- how?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Ay, so the turn were served.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Aaron, thou hast hit it.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Faith, not me.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Nor me, so I were one.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	BASSIANUS	Lavinia, how say you?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	BASSIANUS	The King my brother shall have notice of this.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LAVINIA	O Tamora! thou bearest a woman's face-
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	I will not hear her speak; away with her!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LAVINIA	Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	I know not what it means; away with her!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	QUINTUS	If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARTIUS	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Where is my lord the King?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Here, Tamora; though griev'd with killing grief.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Where is thy brother Bassianus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Andronicus himself did take it up.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	An 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	This was thy daughter.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Why, Marcus, so she is.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Ay me! this object kills me.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	My hand shall go.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	By heaven, it shall not go!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Then I'll go fetch an axe.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	But yet let reason govern thy lament.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	When will this fearful slumber have an end?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Ha, ha, ha!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	At that that I have kill'd, my lord- a fly.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	BOY	Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	BOY	And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	BOY	Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	A charitable wish and full of love.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	And that would she for twenty thousand more.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	To whom?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	NURSE	I mean she is brought a-bed.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	NURSE	A devil.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Villain, what hast thou done?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	That which thou canst not undo.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Thou hast undone our mother.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Villain, I have done thy mother.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	It shall not live.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	It shall not die.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	NURSE	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	NURSE	The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	I blush to think upon this ignomy.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	NURSE	Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	How many women saw this child of his?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in all my life.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's men.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the Emperor from you.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a grace?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Ay, sir.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his foot; then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	God be with you, sir; I will.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Yes, forsooth, an your mistriship be Emperial.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Go take him away, and hang him presently.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	How much money must I have?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Come, sirrah, you must be hang'd.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CLOWN	Hang'd! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair end.                                          [Exit guarded]
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	But he will not entreat his son for us.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AEMILIUS	Your bidding shall I do effectually.            Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	ALL THE GOTHS	And as he saith, so say we all with him.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	O barbarous beastly villains like thyself!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	GOTH	What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	AARON	Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	FIRST GOTH	What says our general?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	These are my ministers, and come with me.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	MARCUS	This will I do, and soon return again.            Exit
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	DEMETRIUS	Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	PUBLIUS	What is your will?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Know you these two?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	PUBLIUS	The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	CHIRON	Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	LUCIUS	What boots it thee to can thyself a sun?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	It was, Andronicus.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Your reason, mighty lord.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TITUS	Will't please you eat?  Will't please your Highness feed?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	TAMORA	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	SATURNINUS	Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	ALL	Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal Emperor!
THE TRAGEDY OF TITUS ANDRONICUS	ALL	Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Will this gear ne'er be mended?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Still have I tarried.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look, or any woman else.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I speak no more than truth.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Thou dost not speak so much.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I have had my labour for my travail, ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labour.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Say I she is not fair?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her the next time I see her. For my part, I'll meddle nor make no more i' th' matter.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Pandarus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Not I.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Sweet Pandarus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I found it, and there an end.               Exit. Sound alarum
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	How now, Prince Troilus! Wherefore not afield?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	That Paris is returned home, and hurt.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	By whom, Aeneas?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Troilus, by Menelaus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Hark what good sport is out of town to-day!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	In all swift haste.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Who were those went by?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ALEXANDER	Queen Hecuba and Helen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	And whither go they?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	What was his cause of anger?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Good; and what of him?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Who comes here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ALEXANDER	Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Hector's a gallant man.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ALEXANDER	As may be in the world, lady.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What's that? What's that?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of?- Good morrow, Alexander.-How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	This morning, uncle.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm'd and gone ere you came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Hector was gone; but Helen was not up.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	E'en so. Hector was stirring early.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	That were we talking of, and of his anger.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Was he angry?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	So he says here.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	True, he was so; I know the cause too; he'll lay about him today, I can tell them that. And there's Troilus will not come far behind him; let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	What, is he angry too?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	'Tis just to each of them: he is himself.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	So he is.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Condition I had gone barefoot to India.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	He is not Hector.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Excuse me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	He is elder.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Pardon me, pardon me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not have his wit this year.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	He shall not need it if he have his own.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Nor his qualities.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	No matter.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Nor his beauty.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	'Twould not become him: his own's better.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	YOU have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th' other day that Troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, I must confess- not brown neither-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	No, but brown.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	To say the truth, true and not true.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	She prais'd his complexion above Paris.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Why, Paris hath colour enough.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	So he has.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other day into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Why, you know, 'tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O, he smiles valiantly!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Does he not?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, I must needs confess.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Without the rack.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh'd that her eyes ran o'er.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	With millstones.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	And Cassandra laugh'd.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o'er too?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	And Hector laugh'd.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	At what was all this laughing?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	What was his answer?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Quoth she 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin, and one of them is white.'
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	This is her question.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	So let it now; for it has been a great while going by.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	So I do.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a man born in April.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle against May.                                    [Sound a retreat]
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Hark! they are coming from the field. Shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward Ilium? Good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	At your pleasure.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Speak not so loud.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Who's that?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Will he give you the nod?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You shall see.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O, a brave man!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Is 'a not? It does a man's heart good. Look you what hacks are on his helmet! Look you yonder, do you see? Look you there. There's no jesting; there's laying on; take't off who will, as they say. There be hacks.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Be those with swords?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Who's that?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Can Helenus fight, uncle?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Where? yonder? That's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus. There's a man, niece. Hem! Brave Troilus, the prince of chivalry!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Peace, for shame, peace!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Achilles? A drayman, a porter, a very camel!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Well, well.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Well, well! Why, have you any discretion? Have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in the pie, for then the man's date is out.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You are such a woman! A man knows not at what ward you lie.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these; and at all these wards I lie at, at a thousand watches.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Say one of your watches.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	BOY	Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Where?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	BOY	At your own house; there he unarms him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Adieu, uncle.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I will be with you, niece, by and by.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	To bring, uncle.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ay, a token from Troilus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What would you fore our tent?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Even this.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	How?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Ay, Greek, that is my name.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What's your affair, I pray you?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Amen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Nestor!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	What says Ulysses?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	What is't?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Well, and how?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	And wake him to the answer, think you?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	I see them not with my old eyes. What are they?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Thersites!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Agamemnon-how if he had boils full, an over, generally?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Thersites!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	And those boils did run-say so. Did not the general run then? Were not that a botchy core?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Dog!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Speak, then, thou whinid'st leaven, speak. I will beat thee into handsomeness.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness; but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst thou? A red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	The proclamation!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Thou art proclaim'd, a fool, I think.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Do not, porpentine, do not; my fingers itch.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I say, the proclamation.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Mistress Thersites!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Thou shouldst strike him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Cobloaf!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a sailor breaks a biscuit.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	You whoreson cur!                               [Strikes him]
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Do, do.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Thou stool for a witch!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinico may tutor thee. You scurvy valiant ass! Thou art here but to thrash Troyans, and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	You dog!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	You scurvy lord!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	You cur!                                        [Strikes him]
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	You see him there, do you?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Ay; what's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Nay, look upon him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	So I do. What's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Nay, but regard him well.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Well! why, so I do.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	But yet you look not well upon him; for who some ever you take him to be, he is Ajax.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	I know that, fool.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Therefore I beat thee.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears thus long. I have bobb'd his brain more than he has beat my bones. I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow. This lord, Achilles, Ajax-who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head-I'll tell you what I say of him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I say this Ajax-             [AJAX offers to strike him]
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Nay, good Ajax.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Has not so much wit-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Nay, I must hold you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he comes to fight.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Peace, fool.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not- he there; that he; look you there.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	O thou damned cur! I shall-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Will you set your wit to a fool's?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	No, I warrant you, the fool's will shame it.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Good words, Thersites.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What's the quarrel?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I serve thee not.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Well, go to, go to.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I serve here voluntary.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	E'en so; a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains: 'a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What, with me too, Thersites?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	There's Ulysses and old Nestor-whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes-yoke you like draught oxen, and make you plough up the wars.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What, what?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Yes, good sooth. To Achilles, to Ajax, to-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I shall cut out your tongue.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	'Tis no matter; I shall speak as much as thou afterwards.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	No more words, Thersites; peace!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	There's for you, Patroclus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	I will see you hang'd like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents. I will keep where there is wit stirring, and leave the faction of fools.                                        Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	A good riddance.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Farewell. Who shall answer him?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	I know not; 'tis put to lott'ry. Otherwise. He knew his man.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	What's aught but as 'tis valued?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CASSANDRA	[Within] Cry, Troyans, cry.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PRIAM	What noise, what shriek is this?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	'Tis our mad sister; I do know her voice.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CASSANDRA	[Within] Cry, Troyans.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Peace, sister, peace.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	If I could 'a rememb'red a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have slipp'd out of my contemplation; but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death. Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where's Achilles?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ay, the heavens hear me!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Who's there?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Thersites, my lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Where, where? O, where? Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Thy knower, Patroclus. Then tell me, Patroclus, what art thou?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Thou must tell that knowest.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	O, tell, tell,
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	You rascal!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Peace, fool! I have not done.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	He is a privileg'd man. Proceed, Thersites.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites is a fool; and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Derive this; come.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Why am I a fool?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Make that demand of the Creator. It suffices me thou art. Look you, who comes here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Where is Achilles?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	I shall say so to him.                              Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Who, Thersites?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	He.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	All the better; their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	No Achilles with him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	I shall, and bring his answer presently.            Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	What is he more than another?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	No more than what he thinks he is.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	No question.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	[Aside] And yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What's his excuse?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	[Aside] O, this is well! He rubs the vein of him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	[Aside] And how his silence drinks up this applause!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	O, no, you shall not go.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	A paltry, insolent fellow!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	[Aside] How he describes himself!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Can he not be sociable?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	[Aside] The raven chides blackness.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I'll let his humours blood.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	[Aside] He will be the physician that should be the patient.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	An all men were a my mind-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	[Aside] Wit would be out of fashion.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	[Aside] An 'twould, you'd carry half.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	[Aside] 'A would have ten shares.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I will knead him, I'll make him supple.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	[Aside] He's not yet through warm. Force him with praises; pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Our noble general, do not do so.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	What a vice were it in Ajax now-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	If he were proud.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Or covetous of praise.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Ay, or surly borne.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Or strange, or self-affected.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Shall I call you father?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Ay, my good son.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Be rul'd by him, Lord Ajax.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You depend upon him, I mean?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You depend upon a notable gentleman; I must needs praise him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	The lord be praised!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You know me, do you not?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	Faith, sir, superficially.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Friend, know me better: I am the Lord Pandarus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	I hope I shall know your honour better.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I do desire it.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	You are in the state of grace.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	I do but partly know, sir; it is music in parts.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Know you the musicians?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	Wholly, sir.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Who play they to?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	To the hearers, sir.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	At whose pleasure, friend?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Command, I mean, friend.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	Who shall I command, sir?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Friend, we understand not one another: I am to courtly, and thou art too cunning. At whose request do these men play?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Who, my cousin, Cressida?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	SERVANT	No, sir, Helen. Could not you find out that by her attributes?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair prince, here is good broken music.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	You have broke it, cousin; and by my life, you shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	He is full of harmony.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Truly, lady, no.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	O, sir-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	Well said, my lord. Well, you say so in fits.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Nay, this shall not hedge us out. We'll hear you sing, certainly-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Well sweet queen, you are pleasant with me. But, marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	My Lord Pandarus, honey-sweet lord-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Go to, sweet queen, go to-commends himself most affectionately to you-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	You shall not bob us out of our melody. If you do, our melancholy upon your head!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Sweet queen, sweet queen; that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall it not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no. -And, my lord, he desires you that, if the King call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	My Lord Pandarus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	What exploit's in hand? Where sups he to-night?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Nay, but, my lord-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen?-My cousin will fall out with you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	You must not know where he sups.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	No, no, no such matter; you are wide. Come, your disposer is sick.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	Well, I'll make's excuse.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	I spy.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Why, this is kindly done.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have, sweet queen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my Lord Paris.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	He! No, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Come, come. I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing you a song now.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou hast a fine forehead.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ay, you may, you may.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Love! Ay, that it shall, i' faith.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	He eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers. Is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's a-field today?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy. I would fain have arm'd to-day, but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my brother Troilus went not?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	He hangs the lip at something. You know all, Lord Pandarus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they spend to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	To a hair.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Farewell, sweet queen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HELEN	Commend me to your niece.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I will, sweet queen.                Exit. Sound a retreat
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	How now! Where's thy master? At my cousin Cressida's?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	O, here he comes. How now, how now!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Sirrah, walk off.                                 Exit Boy
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Have you seen my cousin?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	She's making her ready, she'll come straight; you must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were fray'd with a sprite. I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain; she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en sparrow.                                                     Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	You have bereft me of all words, lady.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Will you walk in, my lord?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	O Cressid, how often have I wish'd me thus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Wish'd, my lord! The gods grant-O my lord!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear. To fear the worst oft cures the worse.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	O, let my lady apprehend no fear! In all Cupid's pageant there is presented no monster.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Nor nothing monstrous neither?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Nothing, but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas, live in fire, cat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite, and the execution confin'd; that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave to limit.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	What, blushing still? Have you not done talking yet?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	I thank you for that; if my lord get a boy of you, you'll give him me. Be true to my lord; if he flinch, chide me for it.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	You know now your hostages: your uncle's word and my firm faith.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won; they are burs, I can tell you; they'll stick where they are thrown.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Pretty, i' faith.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Your leave, sweet Cressid!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Leave! An you take leave till to-morrow morning-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Pray you, content you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	What offends you, lady?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Sir, mine own company.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	You cannot shun yourself.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	In that I'll war with you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Go to, a bargain made; seal it, seal it; I'll be the witness. Here I hold your hand; here my cousin's. If ever you prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to bring you together, let all pitiful goers- between be call'd to the world's end after my name-call them all Pandars; let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all brokers between Pandars. Say 'Amen.'
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Amen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Amen.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	No.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Nothing, my lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Good day, good day.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	How do you? How do you?                              Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What, does the cuckold scorn me?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	How now, Patroclus?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Good morrow, Ajax.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Ha?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Good morrow.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Ay, and good next day too.                               Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Now, great Thetis' son!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What are you reading?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Ha! known!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	A wonder!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	What?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	How so?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	How can that be?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Who, I? Why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking is for beggars: he wears his tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence. Let Patroclus make his demands to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Jove bless great Ajax!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Hum!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	I come from the worthy Achilles-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ha!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Hum!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Agamemnon!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Ay, my lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Ha!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	What you say to't?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	God buy you, with all my heart.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he has me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Fare ye well, with all my heart.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	No, but he's out a tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has knock'd out his brains I know not; but, I am sure, none; unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Let me carry another to his horse; for that's the more capable creature.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	See, ho! Who is that there?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DEIPHOBUS	It is the Lord Aeneas.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	We know each other well.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	We do; and long to know each other worse.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	I was sent for to the King; but why, I know not.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Good morrow, all.                         Exit with servant
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	You are too bitter to your country-woman.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Dear, trouble not yourself; the morn is cold.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Good morrow, then.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	I prithee now, to bed.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Are you aweary of me?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Night hath been too brief.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	[Within] What's all the doors open here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! a poor capocchia! hast not slept to-night? Would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? A bugbear take him!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Ha! ha!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Is not Prince Troilus here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Here! What should he do here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Is he here, say you? It's more than I know, I'll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	How now! What's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Is it so concluded?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	How now! What's the matter? Who was here?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ah, ah!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Why sigh you so profoundly? Where's my lord? Gone? Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O the gods! What's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you, what's the matter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O you immortal gods! I will not go.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Thou must.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Do, do.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Be moderate, be moderate.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O Troilus! Troilus! [Embracing him]
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Have the gods envy?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	And is it true that I must go from Troy?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	A hateful truth.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	What, and from Troilus too?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	From Troy and Troilus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Is't possible?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PANDARUS	Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown up by th' root?                                Exit
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	I must then to the Grecians?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	No remedy.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Hear me, my love. Be thou but true of heart-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	I true! how now! What wicked deem is this?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	And you this glove. When shall I see you?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O heavens! 'Be true' again!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	O heavens! you love me not.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Do you think I will?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	[Within] Nay, good my lord!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Come, kiss; and let us part.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	[Within] Brother Troilus!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	My lord, will you be true?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	Hark! Hector's trumpet.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PARIS	'Tis Troilus' fault. Come, come to field with him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DEIPHOBUS	Let us make ready straight.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	No trumpet answers.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Is this the lady Cressid?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Even she.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	I had good argument for kissing once.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	O, this is trim!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	In kissing, do you render or receive?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Both take and give.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	I'll give you boot; I'll give you three for one.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	You are an odd man; give even or give none.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	You fillip me o' th' head.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	No, I'll be sworn.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	You may.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	I do desire it.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Why, beg then.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	I am your debtor; claim it when 'tis due.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	A woman of quick sense.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Yonder comes the troop.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	Which way would Hector have it?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	If not Achilles, nothing.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	They are oppos'd already.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	They are in action.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	NESTOR	Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	You must no more.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	Princes, enough, so please you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	As Hector pleases.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AJAX	Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	[To Troilus] My well-fam'd lord of Troy, no less to you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Who must we answer?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	The noble Menelaus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	O, pardon; I offend.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AENEAS	'Tis the old Nestor.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	I would they could.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Is this Achilles?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	I am Achilles.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Stand fair, I pray thee; let me look on thee.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Behold thy fill.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Nay, I have done already.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	I tell thee yea.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Thy hand upon that match.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	From whence, fragment?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Who keeps the tent now?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	The surgeon's box or the patient's wound.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Well said, Adversity! and what needs these tricks?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk; thou art said to be Achilles' male varlet.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Male varlet, you rogue! What's that?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the guts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o' gravel in the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, limekilns i' th' palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee- simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous discoveries!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Why, thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest thou to curse thus?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Do I curse thee?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur, no.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	No! Why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of sleid silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pest'red with such water-flies-diminutives of nature!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	PATROCLUS	Out, gall!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Finch egg!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	AGAMEMNON	We go wrong, we go wrong.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	I trouble you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Here comes himself to guide you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ACHILLES	Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, Princes all.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Thanks, and good night to the Greeks' general.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	MENELAUS	Good night, my lord.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Good night, sweet Lord Menelaus.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	HECTOR	Give me your hand.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Sweet sir, you honour me.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	What, are you up here, ho? Speak.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CALCHAS	[Within] Who calls?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Cressid comes forth to him.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	How now, my charge!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Yea, so familiar!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	She will sing any man at first sight.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff; she's noted.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Will you remember?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Remember? Yes.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	What shall she remember?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	List!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	Roguery!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Nay, then-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	I'll tell you what-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Fo, fo! come, tell a pin; you are a forsworn-
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	THERSITES	A juggling trick, to be secretly open.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	What did you swear you would bestow on me?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Good night.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Hold, patience!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	How now, Troyan!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Diomed!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	No, no, good night; I'll be your fool no more.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Thy better must.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Hark! a word in your ear.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	O plague and madness!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Behold, I pray you.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	I prithee stay.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	You have not patience; come.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	And so, good night.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Nay, but you part in anger.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	Doth that grieve thee? O withered truth!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	How now, my lord?
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	By Jove, I will be patient.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	Guardian! Why, Greek!
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	DIOMEDES	Fo, fo! adieu! you palter.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	CRESSIDA	In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	TROILUS	She strokes his cheek.
THE HISTORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	ULYSSES	Come, come.
